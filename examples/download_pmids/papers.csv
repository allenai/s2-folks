Unexpectedly, Makino and colleagues show in this issue of Cancer Research that the constitutive activation of p53 in murine hepatocytes leads to tumor development. Detailed analyses indicate that p53 activation leads to loss of hepatocytes, increased expression of chemokines and humoral factors, and expansion of the hepatic progenitor cell population. These progenitor cells are highly proliferative, show chromosomal instability, and eventually transform. In chronic liver disease in humans, activation of p53 is associated with increased liver cancer development. This study highlights the complexity and non-cell autonomous nature of the physiologic p53 response. See related article by Makino et al., p. 2860."

35563397,Therapeutics Targeting p53-MDM2 Interaction to Induce Cancer Cell Death,35563397,"Named as the guardian of the genome, p53 is a tumor suppressor that regulates cell function, often through many different mechanisms such as DNA repair, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, senescence, metabolism, and autophagy. One of the genes that p53 activates is MDM2, which forms a negative feedback loop since MDM2 induces the degradation of p53. When p53 activity is inhibited, damaged cells do not undergo cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. As 50% of human cancers inactivate p53 by mutation, current research focuses on reactivating p53 by developing drugs that target the p53-MDM2 interaction, which includes the binding of MDM2 and phosphorylation of p53. The objective of this article is to provide a short list and description of p53-MDM2 antagonists that may be excellent candidates for inducing cancer cell death. Relevant articles were searched for and identified using online databases such as PubMed and ScienceDirect. Increasing p53 levels, by targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction, can help p53 play its role as a tumor suppressor and induce cancer cell death. Researchers have identified different compounds that can act as inhibitors, either by directly binding to MDM2 or by modifying p53 with phosphorylation. The results associated with the drugs demonstrate the importance of targeting such interactions to inhibit cancer cell growth, which indicates that the use of the compounds may improve cancer therapeutics."

35804915,p53 Isoforms as Cancer Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets,35804915,"Simple Summary The well-known tumor suppressor protein p53 plays important roles in tumor prevention through transcriptional regulation of its target genes. Reactivation of p53 activity has been a potent strategy for cancer treatment. Accumulating evidences indicate that p53 isoforms truncated/modified in the N- or C-terminus can modulate the p53 pathway in a p53-dependent or p53-independent manner. It is thus imperative to characterize the roles of the p53 isoforms in cancer development. This review illustrates how p53 isoforms participate in tumor development and/or suppression. It also summarizes the knowledge about the p53 isoforms as promising cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Abstract This review aims to summarize the implications of the major isoforms of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in aggressive cancer development. The current knowledge of p53 isoforms, their involvement in cell-signaling pathways, and their interactions with other cellular proteins or factors suggests the existence of an intricate molecular network that regulates their oncogenic function. Moreover, existing literature about the involvement of the p53 isoforms in various cancers leads to the proposition of therapeutic solutions by altering the cellular levels of the p53 isoforms. This review thus summarizes how the major p53 isoforms Δ40p53α/β/γ, Δ133p53α/β/γ, and Δ160p53α/β/γ might have clinical relevance in the diagnosis and effective treatments of cancer."

It has been shown that more than 50% of tumors are connected with mutations in the Tp53 gene. These mutations cause a disturbance in cellular response to stress, and eventually, cancer development. Apart from the full-length p53, at least twelve isoforms of p53 have been characterized. They are able to modulate p53 activity under stress conditions. In 2020, almost a half of million people around the world were diagnosed with renal cancer. One genetic disturbance which is linked to the most common type of kidney cancer, renal cell carcinoma, RCC, occurs from mutations in the VHL gene. Recent data has revealed that the VHL protein is needed to fully activate p53. Disturbance of the interplay between p53 and VHL seems to explain the lack of efficient response to chemotherapy in RCC. Moreover, it has been observed that changes in the expression of p53 isoforms are associated with different stages of RCC and overall survival. Thus, herein, an attempt was made to answer the question whether p53 and its isoforms are important factors in the development of RCC on the one hand, and in positive response to anti-RCC therapy on the other hand."

The abundant post-translational processing and modification endow the functional diversity of p53. Considering the relationship between p53 and liver fibrosis, drug intervention targeting p53 or management of p53 regulation might be effective strategies to treat liver fibrosis. Here, we systematically discuss the regulation of p53 in different liver cells (hepatocytes, immune cells, HSCs, etc) and the role of p53 in the development of liver fibrosis, and propose possible interventions to prevent the pathogenic processes of liver fibrosis."
36638783,p53 engages the cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway for tumor suppression,36638783,"Tumor suppression by p53 is known to involve cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms. p53 has been shown to suppress tumor growth by modulating immune system functions, however, the mechanistic basis for this activity is not well understood. Here we report that p53 promotes the degradation of the DNA exonuclease TREX1, resulting in cytosolic dsDNA accumulation. We demonstrate that p53 requires the ubiquitin ligase TRIM24 to induce TREX1 ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The accumulation of cytosolic DNA due to p53’s suppression of TREX1 activates the cytosolic DNA sensor, cGAS and its downstream effectors STING/TBK1/IRF3 resulting in induction of Type I interferons. TREX1 overexpression sufficed to block WTp53 activation of the cGAS/STING pathway. WTp53 mediated induction of type I interferon (IFNB1) response could be suppressed by cGAS/STING knockout. We find that p53’s tumor suppressor activities are compromised by loss of signaling through the cGAS/STING pathway. Thus, our study reveals that p53 utilizes the cGAS/STING innate immune system pathway for both cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic tumor suppressor activities."
36613518,p53 Family in Resistance to Targeted Therapy of Melanoma,36613518,"Metastatic melanoma is one of the most aggressive tumors, with frequent mutations affecting components of the MAPK pathway, mainly protein kinase BRAF. Despite promising initial response to BRAF inhibitors, melanoma progresses due to development of resistance. In addition to frequent reactivation of MAPK or activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, recently, the p53 pathway has been shown to contribute to acquired resistance to targeted MAPK inhibitor therapy. Canonical tumor suppressor p53 is inactivated in melanoma by diverse mechanisms. The TP53 gene and two other family members, TP63 and TP73, encode numerous protein isoforms that exhibit diverse functions during tumorigenesis. The p53 family isoforms can be produced by usage of alternative promoters and/or splicing on the C- and N-terminus. Various p53 family isoforms are expressed in melanoma cell lines and tumor samples, and several of them have already shown to have specific functions in melanoma, affecting proliferation, survival, metastatic potential, invasion, migration, and response to therapy. Of special interest are p53 family isoforms with increased expression and direct involvement in acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitors in melanoma cells, implying that modulating their expression or targeting their functional pathways could be a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to MAPK inhibitors in melanoma."
35965531,p53 as a biomarker and potential target in gastrointestinal stromal tumors,35965531,"KIT and PDGFRA play a major role in the oncogenic process in gastrointestinal stroma tumors (GIST) and small molecules have been employed with great success to target the KIT and PDGFRA pathways in this cancer. However, approximately 10% of patients with GIST are resistant to current targeted drug therapy. There is a need to explore other potential targets. Although p53 alterations frequently occur in most cancers, studies regarding p53 in GIST have been limited. The CDKN2A/MDM2/p53 axis regulates cell cycle progression and DNA damage responses, which in turn control tumor growth. This axis is the major event required for transformation from low- to high-risk GIST. Generally, p53 mutation is infrequent in GIST, but p53 overexpression has been reported to be associated with high-risk GIST and unfavorable prognosis, implying that p53 should play a critical role in GIST. Also, Wee1 regulates the cell cycle and the antitumor activity of Wee1 inhibition was reported to be p53 mutant dependent. In addition, Wee1 was reported to have potential activity in GIST through the regulation of KIT protein and this mechanism may be dependent on p53 status. In this article, we review previous reports regarding the role of p53 in GIST and propose targeting the p53 pathway as a novel additional treatment strategy for GIST."
35398929,P53 deficiency affects cholesterol esterification to exacerbate hepatocarcinogenesis,35398929,"Background and Aims: Cholesterol ester (CE) biosynthesis and homeostasis play critical roles in many cancers, including HCC, but their exact mechanistic contributions to HCC disease development require further study. Approach and Results: Here, we report on a proposed role of tumor suppressor P53 in its repressing ubiquitin‐specific peptidase 19 (USP19) and sterol O‐acyltransferase (SOAT) 1, which maintains CE homeostasis. USP19 enhances cholesterol esterification and contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis (HCG) by deubiquitinating and stabilizing SOAT1. Loss of either SOAT1 or USP19 dramatically attenuates cholesterol esterification and HCG in P53‐deficient mice fed with either a normal chow diet or a high‐cholesterol, high‐fat diet (HCHFD). SOAT1 inhibitor avasimibe has more inhibitory effect on HCC progression in HCHFD‐maintained P53‐deficient mice when compared to the inhibitors of de novo cholesterol synthesis. Consistent with our findings in the mouse model, the P53‐USP19‐SOAT1 signaling axis is also dysregulated in human HCCs. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings demonstrate that SOAT1 participates in HCG by increasing cholesterol esterification, thus indicating that SOAT1 is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in P53‐deficient HCC."
35888186,Role of p53 in Regulating Radiation Responses,35888186,"p53 is known as the guardian of the genome and plays various roles in DNA damage and cancer suppression. The p53 gene was found to express multiple p53 splice variants (isoforms) in a physiological, tissue-dependent manner. The various genes that up- and down-regulated p53 are involved in cell viability, senescence, inflammation, and carcinogenesis. Moreover, p53 affects the radioadaptive response. Given that several studies have already been published on p53, this review presents its role in the response to gamma irradiation by interacting with MDM2, NF-κB, and miRNA, as well as in the inflammation processes, senescence, carcinogenesis, and radiation adaptive responses. Finally, the potential of p53 as a biomarker is discussed."

To precisely regulate the p53 network, p53 undergoes various post-translational modifications and alters the selectivity of target genes. Acetylation plays an essential role in cell fate determination through the activation of p53. Although the acetylation of p53 has been examined, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unclear and, thus, have attracted the interest of researchers. We herein discuss the role of acetylation in the p53 pathway, with a focus on p53 acetyltransferases and deacetylases. We also review recent findings on the regulators of these enzymes to understand the mode of p53 acetylation from a broader perspective."

36291874,GOF Mutant p53 in Cancers: A Therapeutic Challenge,36291874,"Simple Summary In normal cells, p53 is a protein which regulates the cell cycle progression to ensure normal cell division, growth, and development. However, in cancer, changes in the p53 DNA sequence, called genetic mutation, results in the protein either losing its normal function or exhibiting advanced pro-tumorigenic functions that lead to cancer. Importantly, cancers with mutations in the p53 protein often represent ones which are more aggressive and more resistant to chemotherapy. As a result, many studies have and continue to investigate multiple ways to target mutant p53-bearing cancer using targeted therapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy, and combination therapies. Knowledge of these strategies is important in improving the overall therapeutic response of cancers with mutant p53. This review highlights new strategies and discusses the progression of such therapies. Abstract TP53 is mutated in the majority of human cancers. Mutations can lead to loss of p53 expression or expression of mutant versions of the p53 protein. These mutant p53 proteins have oncogenic potential. They can inhibit any remaining WTp53 in a dominant negative manner, or they can acquire new functions that promote tumour growth, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. In this review we explore some of the mechanisms that make mutant p53 cells resistant to chemotherapy. As mutant p53 tumours are resistant to many traditional chemotherapies, many have sought to explore new ways of targeting mutant p53 tumours and reinstate chemosensitivity. These approaches include targeting of mutant p53 stability, mutant p53 binding partners and downstream pathways, p53 vaccines, restoration of WTp53 function, and WTp53 gene delivery. The current advances and challenges of these strategies are discussed."

The unfavorable response to multimodal therapy and the higher recurrence rate, despite an aggressive approach, make HNSCC a research topic of interest for improving therapeutic outcomes, even if it is only the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. New advances in molecular biology and genetics include the involvement of miRNA in the control of the p53 pathway, the understanding of mechanisms such as gain/loss of function, and the development of different methods to restore p53 function, especially for HPV-negative cases. The different ratio between mutant p53 status in the primary tumor and distant metastasis originating HNSCC may serve to select the best therapeutic target for activating an abscopal effect by radiotherapy as a “booster” of the immune system. P53 may also be a key player in choosing radiotherapy fractionation regimens. Targeting any pathway involving p53, including tumor metabolism, in particular the Warburg effect, could modulate the radiosensitivity and chemo-sensitivity of head and neck cancers."

36232329,Anticancer Therapeutic Strategies Targeting p53 Aggregation,36232329,"p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that is mutated in more than 50% of cancer cases. When mutated, it frequently results in p53 oncogenic gain of function (GOF), resulting in a greater tendency to aggregate in the phase separation and phase transition pathway. GOFs related to p53 aggregation include chemoresistance, which makes therapy even more difficult. The therapies available for the treatment of cancer are still quite limited, so the study of new molecules and therapeutic targets focusing on p53 aggregates is a promising strategy against cancer. In this review, we classify anticancer molecules with antiaggregation properties into four categories: thiol alkylating agents, designed peptides, agents with chaperone-based mechanisms that inhibit p53 aggregation, and miscellaneous compounds with anti-protein aggregation properties that have been studied in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we highlight autophagy as a possible degradation pathway for aggregated p53. Here, considering cancer as a protein aggregation disease, we review strategies that have been used to disrupt p53 aggregates, leading to cancer regression."
35601652,Association of p53 with Neurodegeneration in Parkinson's Disease,35601652,"p53 is a vital transcriptional protein implicated in regulating diverse cellular processes, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, mitochondrial metabolism, redox homeostasis, autophagy, senescence, and apoptosis. Recent studies have revealed that p53 levels and activity are substantially increased in affected neurons in cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as in the brains of PD patients. p53 activation in response to neurodegenerative stress is closely associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, abnormal protein aggregation, and impairment of autophagy, and these pathogenic events have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Pathogenic p53 integrates diverse cellular stresses and activate these downstream events to induce the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons; thus, it plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PD and appears to be a potential target for the treatment of the disease. We reviewed the current knowledge concerning p53-dependent neurodegeneration to better understand the underlying mechanisms and provide possible strategies for PD treatment by targeting p53."
35707366,p53-Mediated Indirect Regulation on Cellular Metabolism: From the Mechanism of Pathogenesis to the Development of Cancer Therapeutics,35707366,"The transcription factor p53 is the most well-characterized tumor suppressor involved in multiple cellular processes, which has expanded to the regulation of metabolism in recent decades. Accumulating evidence reinforces the link between the disturbance of p53-relevant metabolic activities and tumor development. However, a full-fledged understanding of the metabolic roles of p53 and the underlying detailed molecular mechanisms in human normal and cancer cells remain elusive, and persistent endeavor is required to foster the entry of drugs targeting p53 into clinical use. This mini-review summarizes the indirect regulation of cellular metabolism by wild-type p53 as well as mutant p53, in which mechanisms are categorized into three major groups: through modulating downstream transcriptional targets, protein-protein interaction with other transcription factors, and affecting signaling pathways. Indirect mechanisms expand the p53 regulatory networks of cellular metabolism, making p53 a master regulator of metabolism and a key metabolic sensor. Moreover, we provide a brief overview of recent achievements and potential developments in the therapeutic strategies targeting mutant p53, emphasizing synthetic lethal methods targeting mutant p53 with metabolism. Then, we delineate synthetic lethality targeting mutant p53 with its indirect regulation on metabolism, which expands the synthetic lethal networks of mutant p53 and broadens the horizon of developing novel therapeutic strategies for p53 mutated cancers, providing more opportunities for cancer patients with mutant p53. Finally, the limitations and current research gaps in studies of metabolic networks controlled by p53 and challenges of research on p53-mediated indirect regulation on metabolism are further discussed."

36183376,A comprehensive study of p53 protein,36183376,"The protein p53 has been extensively investigated since it was found 43 years ago and has become a “guardian of the genome” that regulates the division of cells by preventing the growth of cells and dividing them, that is, inhibits the development of tumors. Initial proof of protein existence by researchers in the mid‐1970s was found by altering and regulating the SV40 big T antigen termed the A protein. Researchers demonstrated how viruses play a role in cancer by employing viruses' ability to create T‐antigens complex with viral tumors, which was discovered in 1979 following a viral analysis and cancer analog research. Researchers later in the year 1989 explained that in Murine Friend, a virus‐caused erythroleukemia, commonly found that p53 was inactivated to suggest that p53 could be a “tumor suppressor gene.” The TP53 gene, encoding p53, is one of human cancer's most frequently altered genes. The protein‐regulated biological functions of all p53s include cell cycles, apoptosis, senescence, metabolism of the DNA, angiogenesis, cell differentiation, and immunological response. We tried to unfold the history of the p53 protein, which was discovered long back in 1979, that is, 43 years of research on p53, and how p53's function has been developed through time in this article."
34921507,"p53 in senescence – it's a marathon, not a sprint",34921507,"The tumour suppressor p53, a stress‐responsive transcription factor, plays a central role in cellular senescence. The role of p53 in senescence‐associated stable proliferative arrest has been extensively studied. However, increasing evidence indicates that p53 also modulates the ability of senescent cells to produce and secrete diverse bioactive factors (collectively called the senescence‐associated secretory phenotype, SASP). Senescence has been linked with both physiological and pathological conditions, the latter including ageing, cancer and other age‐related disorders, in part through the SASP. Cellular functions are generally dictated by the expression profile of lineage‐specific genes. Indeed, expression of SASP factors and their regulators are often biased by cell type. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that p53 contributes to deregulation of more stringent lineage‐specific genes during senescence. P53 itself is also tightly regulated at the protein level. In contrast to the rapid and transient activity of p53 upon stress (‘acute‐p53’), during senescence and other prolonged pathological conditions, p53 activities are sustained and fine‐tuned through a combination of different inputs and outputs (‘chronic‐p53’)."
36891151,p53 mutation and deletion contribute to tumor immune evasion,36891151,"TP53 (or p53) is widely accepted to be a tumor suppressor. Upon various cellular stresses, p53 mediates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis to maintain genomic stability. p53 is also discovered to suppress tumor growth through regulating metabolism and ferroptosis. However, p53 is always lost or mutated in human and the loss or mutation of p53 is related to a high risk of tumors. Although the link between p53 and cancer has been well established, how the different p53 status of tumor cells help themselves evade immune response remains largely elusive. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of different status of p53 and tumor immune evasion can help optimize the currently used therapies. In this context, we discussed the how the antigen presentation and tumor antigen expression mode altered and described how the tumor cells shape a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment to facilitate its proliferation and metastasis."
35787548,Role of p53 in regulation of hematopoiesis in health and disease,35787548,"Purpose of review Human aging is associated with an exponential increase in the occurrence of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). CHIP is associated with increased risks of de novo and therapy-related hematologic neoplasms and serves as a reservoir for leukemic relapse. Somatic mutations in the TP53 gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein p53, rank in the top five among genes that were mutated in CHIP. TP53 mutations in CHIP are associated with an increased incidence of myeloid neoplasms such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This review focuses on mechanisms by which mutant p53 promotes CHIP progression and drives the pathogenesis of MDS and AML. We will also discuss potential therapeutic approaches that can target mutant p53 and improve treatment outcomes of MDS and AML. Recent findings TP53 was frequently mutated in individuals with CHIP as well as in patients with MDS and AML. While clinical studies suggest that p53 mutant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell expansion may predispose the elderly to hematologic neoplasms, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent findings suggest that mutant p53 may utilize both cell autonomous and noncell autonomous mechanisms to promote CHIP development. Furthermore, we and others have demonstrated that several gain-of-function mutant p53 proteins have enhanced oncogenic potential beyond dominant-negative and loss-of-function effects. Notably, TP53 allelic state has important implications for genome stability, clinical presentation, and outcomes in MDS. Some small molecules reactivating wild-type p53 tumor suppressor activity show promising effects on some human MDS and AML cells with TP53 mutations in preclinical and early phases of clinical studies. Summary TP53 mutations in MDS and AML are correlated with advanced disease, poor prognosis, reduced overall survival, and dismal outcomes. Deep understanding of the functions of mutant p53 proteins is essential to devise effective therapies for patients with myeloid neoplasms and other human cancers with TP53 mutations. Targeting mutant p53 directly or pathways regulated by mutant p53 holds great potential in preventing CHIP progression and treating MDS and AML patients with TP53 mutations."
36230470,Regulating the p53 Tumor Suppressor Network at PML Biomolecular Condensates,36230470,"Simple Summary The cell nucleus is organized into different sub-nuclear compartments to control specific cellular processes, including PML nuclear bodies (NBs), also termed PML biomolecular condensates. PML-NBs form multi-protein complexes that are highly responsive to cellular stress, and regulate cell fate decisions in response to genome damage. By concentrating proteins that directly control the activity of the tumor suppressor p53, PML biocondensates guide the cellular response either towards induction of cell death or senescence through altering p53 modifications. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms controlling PML condensate formation, and how they impact the regulation of p53 activity, and propose a list of promising candidate proteins that may contribute to the regulation of p53 at PML biomolecular condensates. Abstract By forming specific functional entities, nuclear biomolecular condensates play an important function in guiding biological processes. PML biomolecular condensates, also known as PML nuclear bodies (NBs), are macro-molecular sub-nuclear organelles involved in central biological processes, including anti-viral response and cell fate control upon genotoxic stress. PML condensate formation is stimulated upon cellular stress, and relies on protein–protein interactions establishing a PML protein meshwork capable of recruiting the tumor suppressor p53, along with numerous modifiers of p53, thus balancing p53 posttranslational modifications and activity. This stress-regulated process appears to be controlled by liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), which may facilitate regulated protein-unmixing of p53 and its regulators into PML nuclear condensates. In this review, we summarize and discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying PML nuclear condensate formation, and how these impact the biological function of p53 in driving the cell death and senescence responses. In addition, by using an in silico approach, we identify 299 proteins which share PML and p53 as binding partners, thus representing novel candidate proteins controlling p53 function and cell fate decision-making at the level of PML nuclear biocondensates."
36712862,P53 protein and the diseases in central nervous system,36712862,"P53 protein is the product of P53 gene, which is a well acknowledged tumor suppressor gene. The function of P53 and the relevant mechanisms of anti-neoplasm have raised the interest of researchers since many years ago. It is demonstrated that P53 is a basic cell cycle regulator and a strong inhibitor for versatile cancers in humans. However, most research focuses on other organs and systems instead of the central nervous system (CNS). In fact, in recent years, more and more studies have been suggesting that P53 plays a significant role in multiple CNS tumors and other diseases and disorders such as cerebral stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we mainly reviewed the P53’s relationship with CNS tumors, cerebral stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, together with the relevant mechanisms, aiming to summarize the research achievements and providing new insight to the future study on diseases in CNS."
35634298,Cytosolic p53 Inhibits Parkin-Mediated Mitophagy and Promotes Acute Liver Injury Induced by Heat Stroke,35634298,"Heat stroke (HS) is a severe condition characterized by increased morbidity and high mortality. Acute liver injury (ALI) is a well-documented complication of HS. The tumor suppressor p53 plays an important role in regulation of mitochondrial integrity and mitophagy in several forms of ALI. However, the role of p53-regulated mitophagy in HS-ALI remains unclear. In our study, we discovered the dynamic changes of mitophagy in hepatocytes and demonstrated the protective effects of mitophagy activation on HS-ALI. Pretreatment with 3-MA or Mdivi-1 significantly exacerbated ALI by inhibiting mitophagy in HS-ALI mice. Consistent with the animal HS-ALI model results, silencing Parkin aggravated mitochondrial damage and apoptosis by inhibiting mitophagy in HS-treated normal human liver cell line (LO2 cells). Moreover, we described an increase in the translocation of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and cytosolic p53 binds to Parkin in LO2 cells following HS. p53 overexpression using a specific adenovirus or Tenovin-6 exacerbated HS-ALI through Parkin-dependent mitophagy both in vivo and in vitro, whereas inhibition of p53 using siRNA or PFT-α effectively reversed this process. Our results demonstrate that cytosolic p53 binds to Parkin and inhibits mitophagy by preventing Parkin’s translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria, which decreases mitophagy activation and leads to hepatocyte apoptosis in HS-ALI. Overall, pharmacologic induction of mitophagy by inhibiting p53 may be a promising therapeutic approach for HS-ALI treatment."

36497215,The Underestimated Role of the p53 Pathway in Renal Cancer,36497215,"Simple Summary The TP53 tumor suppressor gene, the guardian of the genome, is mutated or has an inactive pathway in most chemo-resistant tumors. Most studies focus on the role of mutated TP53 in tumors. In this review, we discuss the role of p53 pathway alterations in renal cell carcinoma, one of the most chemo-resistant tumors that require clinical and resolutive approaches. Abstract The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is known as the guardian of the genome, playing a pivotal role in controlling genome integrity, and its functions are lost in more than 50% of human tumors due to somatic mutations. This percentage rises to 90% if mutations and alterations in the genes that code for regulators of p53 stability and activity are taken into account. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a clear example of cancer that despite having a wild-type p53 shows poor prognosis because of the high rate of resistance to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, which leads to recurrence, metastasis and death. Remarkably, the fact that p53 is poorly mutated does not mean that it is functionally active, and increasing experimental evidences have demonstrated this. Therefore, RCC represents an extraordinary example of the importance of p53 pathway alterations in therapy resistance. The search for novel molecular biomarkers involved in the pathways that regulate altered p53 in RCC is mandatory for improving early diagnosis, evaluating the prognosis and developing novel potential therapeutic targets for better RCC treatment."
35275031,Targeting long non-coding RNA PVT1/TGF-β/Smad by p53 prevents glioma progression,35275031,"ABSTRACT Glioma is a primary intracranial malignant tumor with poor prognosis, and its pathogenesis is unclear. This study discussed the impact of p53/lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (lncRNA PVT1)/transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)/Smad axis on the biological characteristics of glioma. Glioma and normal tissues were collected, in which relative lncRNA PVT1 and p53 expression was assessed. Pearson’s analysis was adopted for the correlation analysis between lncRNA PVT1 and p53. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) against lncRNA PVT1 (siRNA-PVT1), siRNA-p53 or both was transfected into the glioma cells to evaluate effects of lncRNA PVT1 and p53 on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Mouse xenograft model of glioma was established to verify function of lncRNA PVT1 and p53 in vivo. Relationship among p53, lncRNA PVT1 and TGF-β/Smad was predicted and confirmed. Glioma tissues and cells showed downregulated p53 expression and increased lncRNA PVT1 expression. An adverse relationship was noted between p53 expression and lncRNA PVT1 expression. p53 was shown to be enriched in the lncRNA PVT1 promoter region and resulted in its suppression. p53 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induced apoptosis as well as arrested tumor growth by downregulating lncRNA PVT1. LncRNA PVT1was found to bind to TGF-β and activate TGF-β/Smad pathway, promoting progression of glioma. Consequently, p53 exerts anti-oncogenic function on glioma development by suppressing lncRNA PVT1 and subsequently inactivating TGF-β/Smad pathway."

However, it is unclear how the remaining activities of p53 are regulated after the abrogation of these routine activities. Ferroptosis is a form of iron- and lipid-peroxide-mediated cell death; it is particularly important in p53-mediated carcinogenesis and corresponding cancer prevention. Post-translational modifications have clear impacts on the tumor suppressor function of p53. Here, we review the roles of post-translational modifications in p53-mediated ferroptosis, which promotes the elimination of tumor cells. A thorough understanding of the p53 functional network will be extremely useful in future strategies to identify pharmacological targets for cancer therapy."
37047710,p53 and Myofibroblast Apoptosis in Organ Fibrosis,37047710,"Organ fibrosis represents a dysregulated, maladaptive wound repair response that results in progressive disruption of normal tissue architecture leading to detrimental deterioration in physiological function, and significant morbidity/mortality. Fibrosis is thought to contribute to nearly 50% of all deaths in the Western world with current treatment modalities effective in slowing disease progression but not effective in restoring organ function or reversing fibrotic changes. When physiological wound repair is complete, myofibroblasts are programmed to undergo cell death and self-clearance, however, in fibrosis there is a characteristic absence of myofibroblast apoptosis. It has been shown that in fibrosis, myofibroblasts adopt an apoptotic-resistant, highly proliferative phenotype leading to persistent myofibroblast activation and perpetuation of the fibrotic disease process. Recently, this pathological adaptation has been linked to dysregulated expression of tumour suppressor gene p53. In this review, we discuss p53 dysregulation and apoptotic failure in myofibroblasts and demonstrate its consistent link to fibrotic disease development in all types of organ fibrosis. An enhanced understanding of the role of p53 dysregulation and myofibroblast apoptosis may aid in future novel therapeutic and/or diagnostic strategies in organ fibrosis."

35626668,The Complex Interaction between P53 and miRNAs Joins New Awareness in Physiological Stress Responses,35626668,"This review emphasizes the important role of cross-talk between P53 and microRNAs in physiological stress signaling. P53 responds to stress in a variety of ways ranging from activating survival-promotion pathways to triggering programmed cell death to eliminate damaged cells. In physiological stress generated by any external or internal condition that challenges cell homeostasis, P53 exerts its function as a transcription factor for target genes or by regulating the expression and maturation of a class of small non-coding RNA molecules (miRNAs). The miRNAs control the level of P53 through direct control of P53 or through indirect control of P53 by targeting its regulators (such as MDMs). In turn, P53 controls the expression level of miRNAs targeted by P53 through the regulation of their transcription or biogenesis. This elaborate regulatory scheme emphasizes the relevance of miRNAs in the P53 network and vice versa."
36565718,The ARTS of p53-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis,36565718,"ABSTRACT The tumor-suppressive activity of p53 is largely attributed to its ability to induce cell death, including apoptosis, through transcription-dependent and transcription-independent mechanisms. On the one hand, nuclear p53 transcriptionally activates the expression of a myriad of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family genes, such as NOXA, PUMA, BID, BAD, BIK, BAX, etc., whereas it inactivates the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL1, leading to mitochondrial apoptosis. On the other hand, cytoplasmic p53 also promotes mitochondrial apoptosis by directly associating with multiple BCL-2 family proteins in the mitochondria. Apoptosis-related protein in TGF-β signaling pathway (ARTS), a mitochondria-localized pro-apoptotic protein encoded by an alternative spliced variant of the SEPT4 gene, triggers apoptosis by facilitating proteasomal degradation of BCL-2 and XIAP upon pro-apoptotic stimuli. We recently identified SEPT4/ARTS as a new p53 target gene in response to genotoxic stress. ARTS in turn binds to p53, drives its mitochondrial localization, and enhances the interaction between p53 and BCL-XL, thereby promoting mitochondrial apoptosis. This review will illustrate the mechanisms of p53-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, offer some recently discovered new insights into the functions of ARTS in regulating mitochondrial cell death, and discuss the clinical significance of ARTS in cancer and non-cancer diseases."

36077210,p53 Controls Meiotic Prophase Progression and Crossover Formation,36077210,"Meiosis initiates with the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs) throughout the genome. To avoid genomic instability, these DSBs need to be correctly repaired by homologous recombination. Surveillance mechanisms involving the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway ATM-CHK2-p53 can detect the persistence of unrepaired DBSs and activate the recombination-dependent arrest at the pachytene stage. However, a complete understanding of p53 functions under normal physiological conditions remains lacking. Here, we report a detailed analysis of the p53 role during meiotic prophase in mice spermatocytes. We show that the absence of p53 regulates prophase progression by slowing down the pachytene stage when the recombination-dependent arrest occurs. Furthermore, our results show that p53 is necessary for proper crossover (CO) formation and localization. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of p53 roles during the meiotic prophase."
36620455,The function of p53 and its role in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease compared to age-related macular degeneration,36620455,"The protein p53 is the main human tumor suppressor. Since its discovery, extensive research has been conducted, which led to the general assumption that the purview of p53 is also essential for additional functions, apart from the prevention of carcinogenesis. In response to cellular stress and DNA damages, p53 constitutes the key point for the induction of various regulatory processes, determining whether the cell induces cell cycle arrest and DNA repair mechanisms or otherwise cell death. As an implication, aberrations from its normal functioning can lead to pathogeneses. To this day, neurodegenerative diseases are considered difficult to treat, which arises from the fact that in general the underlying pathological mechanisms are not well understood. Current research on brain and retina-related neurodegenerative disorders suggests that p53 plays an essential role in the progression of these conditions as well. In this review, we therefore compare the role and similarities of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), two of the most prevalent neurological diseases, to the age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which is among the most common forms of retinal degeneration."
35474131,EGFR suppresses p53 function by promoting p53 binding to DNA-PKcs: a noncanonical regulatory axis between EGFR and wild-type p53 in glioblastoma,35474131,"Abstract Background Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification and TP53 mutation are the two most common genetic alterations in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). A comprehensive analysis of the TCGA GBM database revealed a subgroup with near mutual exclusivity of EGFR amplification and TP53 mutations indicative of a role of EGFR in regulating wild-type-p53 (wt-p53) function. The relationship between EGFR amplification and wt-p53 function remains undefined and this study describes the biological significance of this interaction in GBM. Methods Mass spectrometry was used to identify EGFR-dependent p53-interacting proteins. The p53 and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) interaction was detected by co-immunoprecipitation. We used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to knockout EGFR and DNA-PKcs and the Edit-R CRIPSR-Cas9 system for conditional knockout of EGFR. ROS activity was measured with a CM-H2DCFDA probe, and real-time PCR was used to quantify expression of p53 target genes. Results Using glioma sphere-forming cells (GSCs), we identified, DNA-PKcs as a p53 interacting protein that functionally inhibits p53 activity. We demonstrate that EGFR knockdown increased wt-p53 transcriptional activity, which was associated with decreased binding between p53 and DNA-PKcs. We further show that inhibition of DNA-PKcs either by siRNA or an inhibitor (nedisertib) increased wt-p53 transcriptional activity, which was not enhanced further by EGFR knockdown, indicating that EGFR suppressed wt-p53 activity through DNA-PKcs binding with p53. Finally, using conditional EGFR-knockout GSCs, we show that depleting EGFR increased animal survival in mice transplanted with wt-p53 GSCs. Conclusion This study demonstrates that EGFR signaling inhibits wt-p53 function in GBM by promoting an interaction between p53 and DNA-PKcs."
35439056,Cross-talk between mutant p53 and p62/SQSTM1 augments cancer cell migration by promoting the degradation of cell adhesion proteins,35439056,"Significance Missense mutations in the TP53 gene, encoding the p53 tumor suppressor, are very frequent in human cancer. Some of those mutations, particularly the more common (“hotspot”) ones, not only abrogate p53’s tumor suppressor activities but also endow the mutant protein with oncogenic gain of function (GOF). We report that p53R273H, the most common p53 mutant in pancreatic cancer, interacts with the SQSTM1/p62 protein to accelerate the degradation of cell adhesion proteins. This enables pancreatic cancer cells to detach from the epithelial sheet and engage in individualized cell migration, probably augmenting metastatic spread. By providing insights into mechanisms that underpin mutant p53 GOF, this study may suggest ways to interfere with the progression of cancers bearing particular p53 mutants."

Depending on the cellular insult and the mutational status, p53 may trigger opposing activities such as cell death or survival, senescence and cell cycle arrest or proliferative signals, antioxidant or prooxidant activation, glycolysis, or oxidative phosphorylation, among others. By augmenting or repressing specific target genes or directly interacting with cellular partners, p53 accomplishes a particular set of activities. The mechanism in which p53 is activated depends on increased stability through post-translational modifications (PTMs) and the formation of higher-order structures (HOS).

More recently, the p53 protein, well-known as a genome guardian, has gained attention for its potential role in the early evolution of AD. This is due to the central involvement of p53’s in the control of oxidative stress and potential involvement in the Amyloid and Tau pathways. p53 is commonly regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs), which affect its conformation, increasing its capacity to adopt multiple structural and functional states, including those that can affect brain processes, thus contributing to AD development. The following review will explore the impact of p53 PTMs on its function and consequential involvement in AD pathogenesis. The greater understanding of the role of p53 in the pathogenesis of AD could result in more targeted therapies benefiting the many patients of this debilitating disease."

A strong association between protein aggregation and Human diseases (such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease) is well proven. p53 is a transcription factor that is also known as the guardian of the genome associated with cellular processes such as DNA repair, apoptosis, senescence, control of cell cycle, stress signaling and cellular homeostasis. The loss of function mutations in p53 have been implicated in several cancers. Experimental evidences have proposed a possible link between cancer and protein aggregation in evidence of the implication of amyloidogenic mutant proteins in ten different types of cancer. Aggregation studies focusing on different P53 domains, mostly, the central core domain and its mutants under the influence of various environmental conditions and P53 TAD domain (1-63) have been reported. P53 TADs interact with diverse cellular factors to modulate the function of P53 and elicit appropriate cellular response under different stress conditions. In this study, the aggregation of P53 TAD2 domain (38-61) have been studied in isolation. The aggregates were generated in-vitro in acidic pH conditions after in-silico scoring for amyloidogenic propensity and characterized using dye-based assays (ThT and bis-ANS fluorescence), CD spectroscopy, and microscopy (SEM, TEM and AFM). It was observed that P53 TAD2 follows nucleation-dependent kinetics and forms amyloid-like aggregates.

Unlike treatment with high doses of radiation that causes considerable DNA damage resulting in injury and p53 activation, exposure of cells or whole animals to low doses of radiation (LDR, ∼10cGy) can induce a protective radioadaptive response. Despite ample information about the contribution of the p53 pathway to high doses of radiation-induced effects, our understanding of the role of p53 in LDR-induced response remains incomplete. This review provides a brief summary of the p53 response to LDR exposure focusing on metabolic regulation.


CONCLUSION
Consistent with growing evidence indicating a critical role of metabolic pathways in the modulation of stress responses, the radioadaptive response was mediated by the LDR-induced metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Remarkably, this metabolic reprogramming depends on p53 downregulation, suggesting a previously unrecognized p53-mediated metabolic response. Of note is that the LDR-induced p53 response is temporary but may become persistent if LDR exposure is recurrent and protracted. While further investigation is necessary, the model where LDR induces p53 downregulation concurrent with anabolic reprogramming may offer novel mechanistic insight into the radioadaptive response. It suggests a model in which LDR exposure is protective when transient or intermittent but may become detrimental when chronic because prolonged p53 downregulation would lead to inactivation of this critical tumor suppressor, causing a loss of p53-dependent DNA damage checkpoint, genomic instability, dysregulated metabolism, and thus increased cancer risk."

Typically diagnosed in stages three or four, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of death in women, despite accounting for only 2.5% of all female malignancies. The overall 5-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is around 47%; however, this drops to an abysmal 29% for the most common type of ovarian cancer, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). HGSOC has upwards of 96% of cases expressing mutations in p53. Therefore, wild-type (WT) p53 and p53-based therapies have been explored as treatment options via a plethora of drug delivery vehicles including nanoparticles, viruses, polymers, and liposomes.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is a poorly understood salivary gland malignancy with limited therapeutic options. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are considered drivers of cancer progression by mediating tumor recurrence and metastasis. We have shown that clinically relevant small molecule inhibitors of MDM2-p53 interaction activate p53 signaling and reduce the fraction of CSC in MEC. Here we examined the functional role of p53 in the plasticity and self-renewal of MEC CSC.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Using gene silencing and therapeutic activation of p53 we analyzed the cell cycle profiles and apoptosis levels of CSCs in MEC cell lines (UM-HMC-1, -3A, -3B) via flow cytometry and looked at the effects on survival/self-renewal of the CSCs through sphere assays. We evaluated the effect of p53 on tumor development (N=51) and disease recurrence (N=17) using in vivo subcutaneous and orthotopic murine models of MEC. Recurrence was followed for 250 days after tumor resection.


RESULTS
Although p53 activation does not induce MEC CSC apoptosis, it reduces stemness properties such as self-renewal by regulating Bmi-1 expression and driving CSC towards differentiation. In contrast, downregulation of p53 causes expansion of the CSC population while promoting tumor growth. Remarkably, therapeutic activation of p53 prevented CSC-mediated tumor recurrence in preclinical trials.


CONCLUSION
Collectively, these results demonstrate that p53 defines the stemness of MEC and suggest that therapeutic activation of p53 might have clinical utility in patients with salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma."

Mutations in p53 not only impair the tumor suppressive function, but also confer missense mutant p53 (mutp53) with oncogenic activities independent of wild-type p53 (wtp53). Since p53 mutations are cancer-specific, several approaches targeting them have been taken to develop novel cancer therapies, including restoration or stabilization of wtp53 conformation from mutp53, rescue of p53 nonsense mutations, depletion of mutp53 proteins, and induction of p53 synthetic lethality or targeting of vulnerabilities imposed by p53 deficiencies (activated retrotransposons) or mutations (enhanced YAP/TAZ). Here, we summarize clinically available investigational and FDA-approved drugs that target p53 mutations for their mechanisms of action and activities to suppress cancer progression. Abstract Mutations in the tumor suppressor p53 (p53) promote cancer progression. This is mainly due to loss of function (LOS) as a tumor suppressor, dominant-negative (DN) activities of missense mutant p53 (mutp53) over wild-type p53 (wtp53), and wtp53-independent oncogenic activities of missense mutp53 by interacting with other tumor suppressors or oncogenes (gain of function: GOF). Since p53 mutations occur in ~50% of human cancers and rarely occur in normal tissues, p53 mutations are cancer-specific and ideal therapeutic targets. Approaches to target p53 mutations include (1) restoration or stabilization of wtp53 conformation from missense mutp53, (2) rescue of p53 nonsense mutations, (3) depletion or degradation of mutp53 proteins, and (4) induction of p53 synthetic lethality or targeting of vulnerabilities imposed by p53 mutations (enhanced YAP/TAZ activities) or deletions (hyperactivated retrotransposons).

Both DNA and RNA can fold into G-quadruplex in GC-rich regions and increasing shreds of evidence demonstrate that G-quadruplexes have been associated with some important cellular events. Investigation of G-quadruplexes is thus vital to revealing their biological functions. Specific G-quadruplexes are investigated to discover new effective anticancer drugs. Multiple modulations have been discovered between the secondary structure G-quadruplex and p53, probably further influencing the ferroptosis in cancer. G-quadruplex binds to ferric iron-related structures directly and may affect the p53 pathways as well as ferroptosis in cancer. In addition, G-quadruplex also interacts with p53 indirectly, including iron-sulfur cluster metabolism, telomere homeostasis, lipid peroxidation, and glycolysis.

37047343,Roles of p53-Mediated Host–Virus Interaction in Coronavirus Infection,37047343,"The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has garnered global attention due to its highly pathogenic nature and the resulting health crisis and economic burden. Although drugs such as Remdesivir have been considered a potential cure by targeting the virus on its RNA polymerase, the high mutation rate and unique 3’ to 5’ exonuclease with proofreading function make it challenging to develop effective anti-coronavirus drugs. As a result, there is an increasing focus on host–virus interactions because coronaviruses trigger stress responses, cell cycle changes, apoptosis, autophagy, and the dysregulation of immune function and inflammation in host cells. The p53 tumor suppressor molecule is a critical regulator of cell signaling pathways, cellular stress responses, DNA repair, and apoptosis. However, viruses can activate or inhibit p53 during viral infections to enhance viral replication and spread. Given its pivotal role in cell physiology, p53 represents a potential target for anti-coronavirus drugs. This review aims to summarize the relationship between p53 and coronaviruses from various perspectives, to shed light on potential targets for antiviral drug development and vaccine design."
36358595,Molecular Targeting of the Most Functionally Complex Gene in Precision Oncology: p53,36358595,"Simple Summary Precision medicine is a powerful treatment modality for controlling tumor growth. However, given the substantial variability between cancer patients, identifying suitable targets is no easy task. Tumor protein p53 represents one of the most promising anti-cancer drug targets due to its high mutation rate and critical role in tumorigenesis. Despite this, current treatment strategies targeting p53 signaling have only seen modest clinical success presumably due to the complex signaling network surrounding p53 enabling cancer cells to have the ability to adapt to each treatment strategy. This review will focus on the multiple approaches to target p53 and will touch on some of the limitations that may be hindering their clinical success. Abstract While chemotherapy is a key treatment strategy for many solid tumors, it is rarely curative, and most tumor cells eventually become resistant. Because of this, there is an unmet need to develop systemic treatments that capitalize on the unique mutational landscape of each patient’s tumor. The most frequently mutated protein in cancer, p53, has a role in nearly all cancer subtypes and tumorigenesis stages and therefore is one of the most promising molecular targets for cancer treatment. Unfortunately, drugs targeting p53 have seen little clinical success despite promising preclinical data. Most of these drug compounds target specific aspects of p53 inactivation, such as through inhibiting negative regulation by the mouse double minute (MDM) family of proteins. These treatment strategies fail to address cancer cells’ adaptation mechanisms and ignore the impact that p53 loss has on the entire p53 network. However, recent gene therapy successes show that targeting the p53 network and cellular dysfunction caused by p53 inactivation is now possible and may soon translate into successful clinical responses. In this review, we discuss p53 signaling complexities in cancer that have hindered the development and use of p53-targeted drugs. We also describe several current therapeutics reporting promising preclinical and clinical results."
35134126,Wild Type p53 suppresses Formin Binding Protein 17 (FBP17) to reduce invasion.,35134126,"Invading tumor cells develop membrane protruding structures called invadopodia in order to invade and metastasize. Previously, we have reported the role of formin binding protein 17 in extracellular matrix degradation and invadopodia formation in breast cancer cells. Here, we report a novel axis between tumor-suppressor p53 and FBP17. We observed that cell lines with mutant p53 express FBP17 to a higher level. The expression of FBP17 was reduced upon stabilizing WT p53. Further, the IHC analysis of breast cancer tissue microarrays demonstrated the correlation between the accumulation of p53 and enhanced FBP17 staining in invasive ductal carcinomas. The double knockdown of p53 and FBP17 showed the contribution of FBP17 in the invasion of cancer cells where p53 lost the regulatory control over FBP17. Taken together, these studies indicate that FBP17 may be a marker to understand the invasion propensity of breast cancer."
36012344,The p53 and Calcium Regulated Actin Rearrangement in Model Cells,36012344,"Long-term cellular stress maintains high intracellular Ca2+ concentrations which ultimately initiates apoptosis. Our interest is focused on how the gelsolin (GSN) and junctional mediating and regulating Y protein (JMY) play important roles in stress response. Both of these proteins can bind p53 and actin. We investigated using in vitro fluorescence spectroscopy and found that the p53 competes with actin in GSN to inhibit p53–JMY complex formation. A high Ca2+ level initializes p53 dimerization; the dimer competes with actin on JMY, which can lead to p53–JMY cotransport into the nucleus. Here we investigated how the motility and division rate of HeLa cells changes due to low-voltage electroporation of GSN or JMY in scratching assays. We revealed that JMY inhibits their motion, but that it can accelerate the cell division. GSN treatment slows down cell division but does not affect cell motility. HeLa cells fully recovered the gap 20 h after the electroporation with JMY and then started to release from the glass slides. Taken together, our in vitro results indicate that GSN and JMY may play an important role in the cellular stress response."

36099147,P53 Suppressor Gene Tissue Microarray-based Protein Expression Analysis in Meningiomas,36099147,"Abstract Background/Aim: Meningiomas represent the main intracranial primary central nervous system (CNS) tumour in adults worldwide. Oncogenes’ over-activation combined with suppressor genes’ silencing affect negatively the biological behavior of these neoplasms. This study aimed to explore the impact of p53 suppressor gene expression in meningiomas’ clinic-pathological features based on a combination of sophisticated techniques. Materials and Methods: Fifty (n=50) meningiomas were included in the study, comprising a broad spectrum of histopathological subtypes. An immunohistochemistry assay was applied on tissue microarray cores followed by digital image analysis. Results: p53 protein over-expression (high staining intensity levels) was observed in 27/50 (54%) cases, whereas the rest (23/50-/46%) demonstrated moderate to low levels of the protein. p53 over-expression was statistically significantly correlated to the mitotic index of the examined cases (p-value=0.001). Interestingly, the atypical/anaplastic group of histotypes demonstrated the strongest p53 expression rates compared to the others (p-value=0.001). Conclusion: p53 overexpression is observed in a broad spectrum of meningiomas. High expression levels lead to an aggressive biological behavior of the malignancy (combined with increased mitotic rates), especially in atypical and anaplastic sub-types that also have a high recurrence rate."
36225257,Recent findings on the role of wild-type and mutant p53 in cancer development and therapy,36225257,"The p53 protein is a tumor suppressor encoded by the TP53 gene and consists of 393 amino acids with four main functional domains. This protein responds to various cellular stresses to regulate the expression of target genes, thereby causing DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, metabolic changes, and aging. Mutations in the TP53 gene and the functions of the wild-type p53 protein (wtp53) have been linked to various human cancers. Eight TP53 gene mutations are located in codons, constituting 28% of all p53 mutations. The p53 can be used as a biomarker for tumor progression and an excellent target for designing cancer treatment strategies. In wild-type p53-carrying cancers, abnormal signaling of the p53 pathway usually occurs due to other unusual settings, such as high MDM2 expression. These differences between cancer cell p53 and normal cells have made p53 one of the most important targets for cancer treatment. In this review, we have dealt with various issues, such as the relative contribution of wild-type p53 loss of function, including transactivation-dependent and transactivation-independent activities in oncogenic processes and their role in cancer development. We also discuss the role of p53 in the process of ferroptosis and its targeting in cancer treatment. Finally, we focus on p53-related drug delivery systems and investigate the challenges and solutions."
36766831,Encoding and Decoding of p53 Dynamics in Cellular Response to Stresses,36766831,"In the cellular response to stresses, the tumor suppressor p53 is activated to maintain genomic integrity and fidelity. As a transcription factor, p53 exhibits rich dynamics to allow for discrimination of the type and intensity of stresses and to direct the selective activation of target genes involved in different processes including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In this review, we focused on how stresses are encoded into p53 dynamics and how the dynamics are decoded into cellular outcomes. Theoretical modeling may provide a global view of signaling in the p53 network by coupling the encoding and decoding processes. We discussed the significance of modeling in revealing the mechanisms of the transition between p53 dynamic modes. Moreover, we shed light on the crosstalk between the p53 network and other signaling networks. This review may advance the understanding of operating principles of the p53 signaling network comprehensively and provide insights into p53 dynamics-based cancer therapy."

36226181,Mutant p53K120R expression enables a partial capacity to modulate metabolism,36226181,"The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is one of the most studied gene in virtue of its ability to prevent cancer development by regulating apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, autophagy and senescence. Furthermore, the modulation of metabolism by P53 is fundamental for tumor suppressor activity. Studies in mouse models showed that mice carrying TP53 mutations affecting the acetylation in the DNA binding domain still retain the ability to transactivate genes involved in metabolism. Noteworthy, mice expressing the triple 3KR or the single K117R mutant do not show early on-set tumor development in contrast to TP53 −/− mice. Interestingly, the mouse K117R mutation corresponds to the human tumor-derived K120R modification, which abrogates P53-dependent activation of apoptosis without affecting growth arrest. In this study, we investigated the property of the human P53 K120R mutant in the regulation of metabolism by analyzing the transcriptional specificity in yeast- and mammalian-based reporter assays, the metabolic phenotype associated to its expression in colon cancer HCT116 TP53−/− cells and the induction of P53 targets and proteins involved in the antioxidant response. These properties were analyzed in comparison to wild type P53 protein, the human triple mutant corresponding to mouse 3KR and the cancer hot-spot R273H mutant. We confirm the selective functionality of P53 K120R mutant, which shows a transcriptional activity on cell cycle arrest but not on apoptotic targets. Interestingly, this mutant shows a partial transactivation activity on p53 response element belonging to the metabolic target TIGAR. Moreover, we observe a significant uncoupling between oxygen consumption and ATP production associated with higher lipid peroxidation level in all P53 mutants carrying cells with respect to wild type P53 expressing cells. Noteworthy, in the absence of a pro-oxidative challenge, cells expressing K120R mutant retain a partial capacity to modulate glucose metabolism, limiting lipid peroxidation with respect to the other P53 mutants carrying cells. Lastly, especially in presence of human 3KR mutant, a high expression of proteins involved in the antioxidant response is found. However, this response does not avoid the increased lipid peroxidation, confirming that only wild type P53 is able to completely counteract the oxidative stress and relative damages."
36199689,p53 status modifies cytotoxic activity of lactoferrin under hypoxic conditions,36199689,"Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron binding glycoprotein of the transferrin family with a wide spectrum of biological effects, including anti-cancer activity. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of anti-cancer activity of LF have not been fully determined. In this study, we tried to clarify cytotoxic functions of LF on various cell lines under hypoxic conditions and elucidate those molecular mechanisms. Cytotoxic activity of LF on cell lines was found to have a range of sensitivities. Hypoxia decreased sensitivity to LF in KD (lip fibroblast) but increased that in HSC2 (oral squamous cell carcinoma). Expression analyses further revealed that LF treatments increased hypoxic HIF-1α, -2α and p53 proteins in KD but attenuated them in HSC2 cells, and decreased HIF-1 target gene, DEC2, in KD but increased it in HSC2, suggesting a possible relationship between LF-modified DEC2 expression and HIF-α protein. MTT assay strikingly demonstrated that cells expressing mutant-type p53 (MT5) were more sensitive to LF than control HepG2 (hepatoma), suggesting an important role of the p53 signal. Knock-down of TP53 (p53 gene) interestingly reduced sensitivity to LF in HepG2, suggesting that p53 may be a target of LF cytotoxic activity. Further analyses with a ferroptosis promoter or inhibitor demonstrated that LF increased ACSL4 in hypoxic MT5, suggesting LF-induced ferroptosis in cells expressing mutant-type p53. In conclusion, hypoxia was found to regulate cytotoxic activities of LF differently among various cell lines, possibly through the p53 signaling pathway. LF further appeared to regulate ferroptosis through a modification of ACSL4 expression."

36741442,Cytoplasmic p53 aggregates accumulated in p53-mutated cancer correlate with poor prognosis,36741442,"Abstract Recent studies suggested that aggregates of mutant p53 proteins may propagate and impair normal p53 functioning in recipient cells. Our previous study showed that cancer cell-derived p53 aggregates that cells internalized interfered with p53-dependent apoptosis in recipient cells. However, involvement of p53 aggregate propagation in cancer pathology has not been fully elucidated. Here, we screened patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, which is characterized by an extremely high frequency of TP53 gene mutations, to show that patients with cytoplasmic p53 deposits have a poor prognosis compared with patients with complete p53 absence or strong nuclear p53 positivity. Cytoplasmic p53 in the patients with poor prognosis consisted of protein aggregates, which suggests that p53 aggregates are oncogenic drivers. Indeed, an inhibitor of p53 aggregation restored cellular apoptosis, a proper p53 function, in p53 aggregate-bearing patient-derived tumor organoids. In cell-based assays, endogenous and exogenous mutant p53 aggregates hindered chemotherapeutic activity of cisplatin, which depends on normal p53 functions. This inhibition was reduced by blocking p53 aggregation or internalization of p53 aggregates. Our study, thus indicates the involvement of p53 aggregate transmission in poor prognosis and in chemotherapy resistance in cancers."
36514978,Implications of p53 in mitochondrial dysfunction and Parkinson's disease.,36514978,"Purpose: To study the underlying molecular mechanisms of p53 in the mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and provide a potential therapeutic target for PD treatment.Methods: We review the contributions of p53 to mitochondrial changes leading to apoptosis and the subsequent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD.Results: P53 is a multifunctional protein implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular processes via transcription-dependent and transcription-independent mechanisms. Mitochondria are vital subcellular organelles for that maintain cellular function, and mitochondrial defect and impairment are primary causes of dopaminergic neuron degeneration in PD. Increasing evidence has revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction-associated dopaminergic neuron degeneration is tightly regulated by p53 in PD pathogenesis. Neurodegenerative stress triggers p53 activation, which induces mitochondrial changes, including transmembrane permeability, reactive oxygen species production, Ca2+ overload, electron transport chain defects and other dynamic alterations, and these changes contribute to neurodegeneration and are linked closely with PD occurrence and development. P53 inhibition has been shown to attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction and protect dopaminergic neurons from degeneration under conditions of neurodegenerative stress.Conclusions: p53 appears to be a potential target for neuroprotective therapy of PD."
35608342,A Critical Role for p53 during the HPV16 Life Cycle,35608342,"Human papillomaviruses are causative agents in around 5% of all cancers. There are currently no antivirals available to combat these infections and cancers, therefore it remains a priority to enhance our understanding of the HPV life cycle. ABSTRACT Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are causative agents in ano-genital and oral cancers; HPV16 is the most prevalent type detected in human cancers. The HPV16 E6 protein targets p53 for proteasomal degradation to facilitate proliferation of the HPV16 infected cell. However, in HPV16 immortalized cells E6 is predominantly spliced (E6*) and unable to degrade p53. Here, we demonstrate that human foreskin keratinocytes immortalized by HPV16 (HFK+HPV16), and HPV16 positive oropharyngeal cancers, retain significant expression of p53. In addition, p53 levels increase in HPV16+ head and neck cancer cell lines following treatment with cisplatin. Introduction of full-length E6 into HFK+HPV16 resulted in attenuation of cellular growth (in hTERT immortalized HFK, E6 expression promoted enhanced proliferation). An understudied interaction is that between E2 and p53 and we investigated whether this was important for the viral life cycle. We generated mutant genomes with E2 unable to interact with p53 resulting in profound phenotypes in primary HFK. The mutant induced hyper-proliferation, but an ultimate arrest of cell growth; β-galactosidase staining demonstrated increased senescence, and COMET assays showed increased DNA damage compared with HFK+HPV16 wild-type cells. There was failure of the viral life cycle in organotypic rafts with the mutant HFK resulting in premature differentiation and reduced proliferation. The results demonstrate that p53 expression is critical during the HPV16 life cycle, and that this may be due to a functional interaction between E2 and p53. Disruption of this interaction has antiviral potential. IMPORTANCE Human papillomaviruses are causative agents in around 5% of all cancers. There are currently no antivirals available to combat these infections and cancers, therefore it remains a priority to enhance our understanding of the HPV life cycle. Here, we demonstrate that an interaction between the viral replication/transcription/segregation factor E2 and the tumor suppressor p53 is critical for the HPV16 life cycle. HPV16 immortalized cells retain significant expression of p53, and the critical role for the E2-p53 interaction demonstrates why this is the case. If the E2-p53 interaction is disrupted then HPV16 immortalized cells fail to proliferate, have enhanced DNA damage and senescence, and there is premature differentiation during the viral life cycle. Results suggest that targeting the E2-p53 interaction would have therapeutic benefits, potentially attenuating the spread of HPV16."

The current work studies stress-induced activation of p53 in anoxic crayfish (Faxonius virilis). Relative levels of target proteins and mRNAs involved in the DNA damage response was measured in normoxic control and anoxic hepatopancreas and tail muscle. Phosphorylation levels of p53 was assessed using immunoblotting at sites known to be phosphorylated (Serine 15 and 37) in response to DNA damage or reduced oxygen signaling. The capacity for DNA binding by phospho-p53 was also measured, followed by transcript analysis of a potentially pro-apoptotic downstream target, the etoposide induced (ei24) gene. Following this, both inhibitor (MDM2) and activator (p19-ARF) protein levels in response to low oxygen stress were studied. The results showed an increase in p53 levels during anoxia in both hepatopancreases and tail muscle. Increased transcript levels of ei24, a downstream target of p53, support the activation of p53 under anoxic stress. Cytoplasmic accumulation of Ser-15 p-p53 was observed during anoxia when proteins from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were measured. Increased cytoplasmic concentration is known to initiate an apoptotic response, which can be assumed as a preparatory step to prevent autophagy. The results suggest that p53 might play a protective role in crayfish defense against low oxygen stress. Understanding how anoxia-tolerant organisms are able to protect against DNA damage could provide important clues towards survival under metabolic rate depression and preparation for recovery to minimize damage."

Mutations affecting the gene TP53 occur in pre-leukemic hema-topoietic stem/progenitor cells (preL-HSPC) and lead to chemoresistance. Many of these mutations cause a conformational change and some of them were shown to enhance self-renewal capacity of preL-HSPC. Intriguingly, a misfolded P53 was described in AML blasts that do not harbor mutations in TP53, emphasizing the dynamic equilibrium between wild-type (WT) and “pseudo-mutant” conformations of P53. By combining single cell analyses and P53 conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies we studied preL-HSPC from primary human DNMT3A-mutated AML samples. We found that while leu-kemic blasts express mainly the WT conformation, in preL-HSPC the pseudo-mutant conformation is the dominant. HSPC from non-leukemic samples expressed both conformations to a similar extent. In a mouse model we found a small subset of HSPC with a dominant pseudo-mutant P53. This subpopulation was significantly larger among DNMT3AR882H-mutated HSPC, suggesting that while a pre-leukemic mutation can predispose for P53 misfolding, additional factors are involved as well. Treatment with a short peptide that can shift the dynamic equilibrium favoring the WT conformation of P53, specifically eliminated preL-HSPC that had dysfunctional canonical P53 pathway activity as reflected by single cell RNA sequencing. Our observations shed light upon a possible targetable P53 dysfunction in human preL-HSPC carrying DNMT3A mutations. This opens new avenues for leukemia prevention."

35674441,LMP1 Induces p53 Protein Expression via the H19/miR-675-5p Axis,35674441,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the first virus to be known to have direct association with human cancer and to be considered as an important DNA tumor virus. The EBV life cycle consists of both latent and lytic modes of infection in B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. ABSTRACT Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous oncogenic herpesvirus, infects more than 90% of the adult population worldwide. The long noncoding RNA H19 is downregulated in EBV-positive gastric cancer (EBVaGC) and nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). In this study, we found that loss of H19 is caused by hypermethylation status of the H19 promoter in EBV-positive GC and NPC cell lines. Furthermore, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), encoded by EBV, induced H19 promoter hypermethylation and deregulated the expression of H19 by upregulating DNMT1 expression. Transwell assays showed that H19 promoted cell migration. Furthermore, H19 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays, respectively. p53, a well-known tumor suppressor, was upregulated in EBVaGC and NPC cell lines. miR-675-5p derived from H19 inhibited p53 protein expression by targeting the 3′ untranslated region of the gene. Overall, we found that LMP1 induced p53 protein expression via the H19/miR-675-5p axis in EBVaGC and NPC. LMP1 induced H19 promoter hypermethylation, which repressed the expression of H19 and miR-675-5p and caused p53 protein overexpression in EBVaGC and NPC cells. IMPORTANCE Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the first virus to be known to have direct association with human cancer and to be considered as an important DNA tumor virus. The EBV life cycle consists of both latent and lytic modes of infection in B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. The persistence of EBV genomes in malignant cells promoted cell growth. p53, acting as a critical gatekeeper tumor suppressor, is involved in multiple virus-mediated tumorigeneses. Overexpression of p53 inhibits the ability of BZLF1 (EBV-encoded immediate early gene) to disrupt viral latency. In our study, we found LMP1 induces H19 promoter hypermethylation, which represses the expression of H19 and miR-675-5p and results in p53 protein overexpression in EBVaGC and NPC cells. These observations suggest a new mechanism of aberrant expression of p53 by LMP1, which facilitates EBV latency."

The tumor-suppressive molecules Maspin and p53 were demonstrated to play a crucial role in body epithelial and immune homeostasis. Downregulation of Maspin and mutation of p53 were frequently associated with malignant transformation and poor prognosis in various human cancers. In this review, we focused on summarizing the progress of the molecular network of Maspin in studying epithelial tumorous development and its response to clinic treatment and try to clarify the underlying antitumor mechanism. Notably, Maspin expression was reported to be transcriptionally activated by p53, and the transcriptional activity of p53 was demonstrated to be enhanced by its acetylation through inhibition of HDAC1. As an endogenous inhibitor of HDAC1, Maspin possibly potentiates the transcriptional activity of p53 by acetylating the p53 protein. Hereby, it could form a “self-propelling” antitumor mechanism. Thus, we summarized that, upon stimulation of cellular stress and by integrating with p53, the aroused Maspin played the epigenetic surveillant role to prevent the epithelial digressional process and retune the epithelial homeostasis, which is involved in activating host immune surveillance, regulating the inflammatory factors, and fine-tuning its associated cell signaling pathways. Consequentially, in a normal physiological condition, activation of the above “self-propelling” antitumor mechanism of Maspin and p53 could reduce cellular stress (e.g., chronic infection/inflammation, oxidative stress, transformation) effectively and achieve cancer prevention. Meanwhile, designing a strategy of mimicking Maspin’s epigenetic regulation activity with integrating p53 tumor-suppressive activity could enhance the chemotherapy efficacy theoretically in a pathological condition of cancer."

However, CRISPR/Cas9 generates DNA damage, which triggers a DNA damage response centered around the tumor-suppressor p53. In this research perspective, we discuss implications of this and describe a CRISPR-p53 interactome with cancer-related genes that, if mutated, can give cells a selective advantage following exposure to CRISPR/Cas9.

36825429,p53 protects against alcoholic fatty liver disease via ALDH2 inhibition,36825429,"The tumor suppressor p53 is critical for tumor suppression, but the regulatory role of p53 in alcohol‐induced fatty liver remains unclear. Here, we show a role for p53 in regulating ethanol metabolism via acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), a key enzyme responsible for the oxidization of alcohol. By repressing ethanol oxidization, p53 suppresses intracellular levels of acetyl‐CoA and histone acetylation, leading to the inhibition of the stearoyl‐CoA desaturase‐1 (SCD1) gene expression. Mechanistically, p53 directly binds to ALDH2 and prevents the formation of its active tetramer and indirectly limits the production of pyruvate that promotes the activity of ALDH2. Notably, p53‐deficient mice exhibit increased lipid accumulation, which can be reversed by ALDH2 depletion. Moreover, liver‐specific knockdown of SCD1 alleviates ethanol‐induced hepatic steatosis caused by p53 loss. By contrast, overexpression of SCD1 in liver promotes ethanol‐induced fatty liver development in wild‐type mice, while it has a mild effect on p53−/− or ALDH2−/− mice. Overall, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized function of p53 in alcohol‐induced fatty liver and uncover pyruvate as a natural regulator of ALDH2."
35813324,The miRNA-34a/Sirt1/p53 pathway in a rat model of lens regeneration,35813324,"Background There are many molecular factors involved in Wolffian and corneal lens regeneration, but few in lens regeneration by lens epithelial cells (LECs) in mammals. Silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) has a variety of physiological functions, such as a transport hub, and is involved in pathological conditions. We studied the expression of the microRNA (miRNA)-34a/Sirt1/tumor protein p53 (p53) pathway in a rat model of lens regeneration. Methods We performed extracapsular lens extraction in 42 healthy female Sprague-Dawley rats. Slit lamp observation was performed at 3, 7, 14, 21, 30, 60 and 90 days postoperatively, and the rats were killed humanely by cervical dislocation at 30, 60 and 90 days postoperatively to remove the eyeballs. We performed semiquantitative immunofluorescence analysis of Sirt1, p53, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibronectin (fn), and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect the relative expressions of miRNA-34a, Sirt1, p53, aquaporin 0 (AQP 0), γA-crystallin, and beaded filament structural protein 1 (BFSP1) mRNA in the lens and posterior capsule. Results The posterior capsule wrinkled at 3 days and it increased at 7 days. At 14 days, pearl-like opacification appeared under the capsule, with increasing shrinkage. Greater mass-like proliferators in size and number accumulated under the capsule and at the equator after 21 days. A regenerated lens developed in the central depression of the capsule at 30 days, slightly protruding from it. Despite being thickened at 60 days, the central depression persisted, with a smaller change at 90 days than at 60 days. Although the relative mRNA expression of miRNA-34a and p53 in the lens and posterior capsule decreased over time (P=0.000), that of Sirt1 increased (P<0.01). α-SMA was uniformly expressed in the crystals and gradually decreased, while fn expression gradually increased. Conclusions miRNA-34a expression decreased and Sirt1 expression increased during lens regeneration. Furthermore, p53 expression decreased, thus reducing apoptosis. Therefore, Sirt1 acted as a key factor in the pathway, and played a protective role in lens regeneration."
36499487,Bromodomain Protein BRD4-Mediated Mutant p53 Transcription Promotes TNBC Progression,36499487,"TP53 is the most common mutated gene in human cancer. Mutant p53 protein loses its tumor-suppressor properties and gains oncogenic activity. Mutant p53 is a therapeutic target in a broad range of cancer types. However, how mutant p53 is epigenetically regulated during tumor progression remains elusive. In this study, we found that the upregulation of mutant p53 is mediated by bromodomain protein BRD4 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Inhibition of BRD4 with its inhibitor JQ1 or knockdown of BRD4 suppressed the transcription of mutant p53, which led to the re-expression of p21, the inhibition of S-phase entry, and colony formation in TNBC cells. BRD4 also positively regulated the transcription of wild-type p53, whereas JQ1 treatment and knockdown of BRD4 decreased the expression of p21 in MCF-7 cells. Knockdown of BRD4 resulted in attenuation of TNBC tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our results uncover a novel regulatory mechanism of mutant p53 via BRD4, and suggest that the bromodomain inhibitor suppresses tumorigenesis through targeting mutant p53 in TNBC."

36714865,Structural basis for p53 binding to its nucleosomal target DNA sequence,36714865,"Abstract The tumor suppressor p53 functions as a pioneer transcription factor that binds a nucleosomal target DNA sequence. However, the mechanism by which p53 binds to its target DNA in the nucleosome remains elusive. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the p53 DNA-binding domain and the full-length p53 protein complexed with a nucleosome containing the 20 base-pair target DNA sequence of p53 (p53BS). In the p53-nucleosome structures, the p53 DNA-binding domain forms a tetramer and specifically binds to the p53BS DNA, located near the entry/exit region of the nucleosome. The nucleosomal position of the p53BS DNA is within the genomic p21 promoter region. The p53 binding peels the DNA from the histone surface, and drastically changes the DNA path around the p53BS on the nucleosome. The C-terminal domain of p53 also binds to the DNA around the center and linker DNA regions of the nucleosome, as revealed by hydroxyl radical footprinting. These results provide important structural information for understanding the mechanism by which p53 binds the nucleosome and changes the chromatin structure for gene activation."

35977539,Sall4 guides p53-mediated enhancer interference upon DNA damage in mouse embryonic stem cells.,35977539,"p53 plays pivotal roles in maintaining the genomic stability of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) through transcriptionally activating and repressing target genes. However, how p53 recognizes its repressed targets remains largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that Sall4 negatively regulates DNA damage induced apoptosis (DIA) of mESCs through mediating p53 recruitment to enhancers of ESC-associated genes repressed by p53 from promoters of p53-activated genes. Upon DNA damage, Sall4 is transcriptionally repressed by p53, and plays an anti-apoptotic role without altering p53 activation. Moreover, Sall4 is identified as a novel p53-interacting partner. Consistently, Sall4 exerts its anti-apoptotic function in a p53-dependent manner. Intriguingly, Sall4 depletion not only promotes the transcriptional activation of several p53-regulated pro-apoptotic genes but also compromises p53-mediated repression of ESC master transcription factors in response to DNA damage. Mechanistically, Sall4 balances p53-binding affinity between p53-activated and -repressed genes through tethering p53 to ESC enhancers. In light of our study, Sall4 may contribute to tumorigenesis by antagonizing p53-mediated apoptosis."
35877475,Decreased DNA Damage and Improved p53 Specificity of RITA Analogs,35877475,"Abstract Reactivation of p53 tumor-suppressor function by small molecules is an attractive strategy to defeat cancer. A potent p53-reactivating molecule RITA, which triggers p53-dependent apoptosis in human tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, exhibits p53-independent cytotoxicity due to modifications by detoxification enzyme Sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1), producing a reactive carbocation. Several synthetic modifications to RITA's heterocyclic scaffold lead to higher energy barriers for carbocation formation. In this study, we addressed the question whether RITA analogs NSC777196 and NSC782846 can induce p53-dependent apoptosis without SULT1A1-dependent DNA damage. We found that RITA analog NSC782846, but not NSC777196, induced p53-regulated genes, targeted oncogene addiction, and killed cancer cells upon p53 reactivation, but without induction of DNA damage and inhibition RNA pol II. Our results might demonstrate a method for designing more specific and potent RITA analogs to accelerate translation of p53-targeting compounds from laboratory bench to clinic."

TP53 is reported as a positive regulatory predictor of immune efficacy. The correlation of p53 expression or mutation and PD-L1 expression is explored. By immunohistochemistry, PD-L1 expression between p53 mutation (missense and nonsense) and wild type; p53 no-expression/loss vs. expression were compared. There was a significant association between p53 mutation, especially missense mutation with higher histological grade, and PD-L1 expression in immune cells (ICs). Both p53 missense mutation and PD-L1 expression may be potential targets for improving immunotherapy response in TNBC."

Under these conditions, p53 interacts with transcription factor Forkhead box O (FOXO) 4, thereby inducing cellular senescence by upregulating the transcription of senescence‐associated protein p21. However, the structural details of this interaction remain unclear. Here, we characterize the interaction between p53 and FOXO4 by NMR, chemical cross‐linking, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Our results reveal that the interaction between p53 TAD and the FOXO4 Forkhead domain is essential for the overall stability of the p53:FOXO4 complex. Furthermore, contacts involving the N‐terminal segment of FOXO4, the C‐terminal negative regulatory domain of p53 and the DNA‐binding domains of both proteins stabilize the complex, whose formation blocks p53 binding to DNA but without affecting the DNA‐binding properties of FOXO4. Therefore, our structural findings may help to understand the intertwined functions of p53 and FOXO4 in cellular homeostasis, longevity, and stress response."

We examined whether increasing p53 signaling in the tumor microenvironment influences antitumor T cell immunity. Our findings indicate that increased p53 signaling induced either pharmacologically with APR-246 (eprenetapopt) or in p53-overexpressing transgenic mice can disinhibit antitumor T cell immunity and augment the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. We demonstrated that increased p53 expression in tumor-associated macrophages induces canonical p53-associated functions such as senescence and activation of a p53-dependent senescence-associated secretory phenotype. This was linked with decreased expression of proteins associated with M2 polarization by tumor-associated macrophages. Our preclinical data led to the development of a clinical trial in patients with solid tumors combining APR-246 with pembrolizumab. Biospecimens from select patients participating in this ongoing trial showed that there was a suppression of M2-polarized myeloid cells and increase in T cell proliferation with therapy in those who responded to the therapy. Our findings, based on both genetic and a small molecule–based pharmacological approach, suggest that increasing p53 expression in tumor-associated macrophages reprograms the tumor microenvironment to augment the response to immune checkpoint blockade."

In the presence of genotoxic stress, p53 is activated to facilitate DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. In breast cancer, the tumor suppressive activities of p53 are frequently inactivated by either the overexpression of its negative regulator MDM2, or mutation which is present in 30-35% of all breast cancer cases. Notably, the frequency of p53 mutation is highly subtype dependent in breast cancers, with majority of hormone receptor-positive or luminal subtypes retaining the wild-type p53 status while hormone receptor-negative patients predominantly carry p53 mutations with gain-of-function oncogenic activities that contribute to poorer prognosis. Thus, a two-pronged strategy of targeting wild-type and mutant p53 in different subtypes of breast cancer can have clinical relevance. The development of p53-based therapies has rapidly progressed in recent years, and include unique small molecule chemical inhibitors, stapled peptides, PROTACs, as well as several genetic-based approaches using vectors and engineered antibodies. In this review, we highlight the therapeutic strategies that are in pre-clinical and clinical development to overcome p53 inactivation in both wild-type and mutant p53-bearing breast tumors, and discuss their efficacies and limitations in pre-clinical and clinical settings."

The p53–MDM2 pathway has coevolved, with MDM2 remaining largely conserved, whereas the TP53 gene morphed into various isoforms. Studies on prevertebrate ancestral homologs revealed the transition from an environmentally induced mechanism activating p53 to a tightly regulated system involving cell signaling. The evolution of this mechanism depends on structural changes in the interacting protein motifs. Elephants such as Loxodonta africana constitute ideal models to investigate this coevolution as they are large and long-living as well as having 20 copies of TP53 isoformic sequences expressing a variety of BOX-I MDM2-binding motifs. Collectively, these isoforms would enhance sensitivity to cellular stresses, such as DNA damage, presumably accounting for strong cancer defenses and other adaptations favoring healthy aging. Here we investigate the molecular evolution of the p53–MDM2 system by combining in silico modeling and in vitro assays to explore structural and functional aspects of p53 isoforms retaining the MDM2 interaction, whereas forming distinct pools of cell signaling. The methodology used demonstrates, for the first time that in silico docking simulations can be used to explore functional aspects of elephant p53 isoforms. Our observations elucidate structural and mechanistic aspects of p53 regulation, facilitate understanding of complex cell signaling, and suggest testable hypotheses of p53 evolution referencing Peto’s Paradox."

Current treatments leverage signaling pathways that are often compromised by disease-derived deficiencies in tumor suppressors. P53 falls into this category as genetic mutations lead to physical changes in the protein that impact multiple cellular pathways. Here, we show the first complete structural models of mutated p53 to reveal how hotspot mutations physically deviate from the wild-type protein. We employed a recently determined structure for the p53 monomer to map seven frequent clinical mutations using computational modeling approaches. Results showed that missense mutations often changed the conformational structure of p53 in the DNA-binding site along with its electrostatic surface charges. We posit these changes may amplify the toxic effects of these hotspot mutations by destabilizing an important zinc ion coordination region in p53 to impede proper DNA interactions. These results highlight the imperative need for new studies on patient-derived proteins that may assist in redesigning structure-informed targeted therapies."
37065475,The regulatory effects of p53 on the typical and atypical ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma: A systematic review,37065475,"Study background: As a rare condition, osteosarcoma affects approximately 3% of all cancer patients. Its exact pathogenesis remains largely unclear. The role of p53 in up- and down-regulating atypical and typical ferroptosis in osteosarcoma remains unclear. The primary objective of the present study is investigating the role of p53 in regulating typical and atypical ferroptosis in osteosarcoma. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Studies (PICOS) protocol were used in the initial search. The literature search was performed in six electronic databases, including EMBASE, Cochrane library of trials, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus Review, using keywords connected by Boolean operators. We focused on studies that adequately defined patient profiles described by PICOS. Results and discussion: We found that p53 played fundamental up- and down-regulatory roles in typical and atypical ferroptosis, resulting in either advancement or suppression of tumorigenesis, respectively. Direct and indirect activation or inactivation of p53 downregulated its regulatory roles in ferroptosis in osteosarcoma. Enhanced tumorigenesis was attributed to the expression of genes associated with osteosarcoma development. Modulation of target genes and protein interactions, especially SLC7A11, resulted in enhanced tumorigenesis. Conclusion: Typical and atypical ferroptosis in osteosarcoma were regulatory functions of p53. The activation of MDM2 inactivated p53, leading to the downregulation of atypical ferroptosis, whereas activation of p53 upregulated typical ferroptosis. Further studies should be performed on the regulatory roles of p53 to unmask its possible clinical applications in the management of osteosarcoma."

36134028,A p53 transcriptional signature in primary and metastatic cancers derived using machine learning,36134028,"The tumor suppressor gene, TP53, has the highest rate of mutation among all genes in human cancer. This transcription factor plays an essential role in the regulation of many cellular processes. Mutations in TP53 result in loss of wild-type p53 function in a dominant negative manner. Although TP53 is a well-studied gene, the transcriptome modifications caused by the mutations in this gene have not yet been explored in a pan-cancer study using both primary and metastatic samples. In this work, we used a random forest model to stratify tumor samples based on TP53 mutational status and detected a p53 transcriptional signature. We hypothesize that the existence of this transcriptional signature is due to the loss of wild-type p53 function and is universal across primary and metastatic tumors as well as different tumor types. Additionally, we showed that the algorithm successfully detected this signature in samples with apparent silent mutations that affect correct mRNA splicing. Furthermore, we observed that most of the highly ranked genes contributing to the classification extracted from the random forest have known associations with p53 within the literature. We suggest that other genes found in this list including GPSM2, OR4N2, CTSL2, SPERT, and RPE65 protein coding genes have yet undiscovered linkages to p53 function. Our analysis of time on different therapies also revealed that this signature is more effective than the recorded TP53 status in detecting patients who can benefit from platinum therapies and taxanes. Our findings delineate a p53 transcriptional signature, expand the knowledge of p53 biology and further identify genes important in p53 related pathways."

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the impact of alterations of the p53 gene and its negative feedback regulator, MDM2, on the expression of hTERT, VEGF, and MMPs; the critical genes involved in oral cancer progression. Material and methods: p53 and MDM2 genotyping were done by PCR-RFLP. p53 mutation analysis was performed using PCR-SSCP and sequencing. hTERT, VEGFA isoforms, MMP2, and MMP9 mRNA levels were analyzed by semi-quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR. Results: Arg allele at p53 exon 4 was significantly associated with overexpression of hTERT, MMP2, and MMP9 individually. Expression of hTERT, VEGF A isoforms, MMP2 and MMP9 were significantly altered in the presence of p53 and MDM2 polymorphisms and p53 mutations in a specific combination. Mutant p53, Arg allele at p53 exon 4 locus, and G/G/or T/T genotype at MDM2revealed increased expression of hTERT, VEGF A isoforms, and MMP2/9. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that apart from mutant p53, naturally occurring sequence variants in p53codon 72 (Arg72Pro) (rs1042522) and MDM2 (rs2279744) significantly alter the expression of hTERT, VEGF-A isoforms, and MMP2/9 in a specific combination. The differential interaction of codon 72 variants with MDM2, hTERT, VEGF-A isoforms and MMP2/9 play a role in the aggressiveness of oral cancer. The results have important implications for oral cancer progression and should be explored for innovative treatment options."
36961913,Genetic modifiers of p53: opportunities for breast cancer therapies,36961913,"Each day our cells encounter a wide range of genomic damage and the p53 protein arbitrates decisions of cell cycle arrest to allow repair of DNA or promote elimination of cells with malignant potential through apoptosis. The prevalence of TP53 mutations in nearly all tumors emphasizes its role as a formidable barrier that must be breached to allow oncogenic transformation. Inherited mutations in TP53 are also the primary genetic lesions found in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), a familial cancer predisposition characterized by tumors in many tissues [1, 2]. However, tissues are not all equally vulnerable to disruptions in p53 function. Among women with inherited mutations in TP53, breast cancer is by far the most common tumor (Figure 1) [3]. Somatic mutations in TP53 are also prevalent in sporadic breast cancers, especially in the triple-negative subtype [4]. The proportion rises to nearly 50% of breast cancers that exhibit impaired function of the p53 pathway based on gene expression signatures as a surrogate biomarker of p53 activity [5–7]. Therefore, the breast epithelium appears to be uniquely sensitive to alterations in p53 function. The pattern of cancer-associated mutations in TP53 is distinct among tumor suppressor genes as missense mutations are the most common. Missense mutations are distributed throughout p53 leaving the protein-coding region intact but its function altered. This pattern is also found in women with inherited mutations in TP53 who develop breast cancers (Figure 2) [8]. Missense mutations affecting codons R175, G245, R248 and R273 within the DNA binding domain account for 26% of the total and have been associated with dominant-negative activities. The majority of the remaining 37% of missense mutations exhibit partial or complete loss of function based on transactivation criteria [8]. Nonsense, frameshift, splice mutations and deletions make up the remaining 31% and also cause loss of function in most cases. Thus, the mutational spectrum is similar to that found in other"

However, the dependency of p53 status is still controversial for predicting the priority of such synergy. This study aimed at expounding the differential therapeutic properties of gemcitabine sensitization by Chk1 inhibition potentially affected by p53 status. We introduced wild-type and hotspot mutant p53 in p53-null H1299 cells, and quantified combination of gemcitabine with two Chk1 inhibitors using Chou-Talalay method. As a result, depletion of p53 preferentially produced synergistic effects. Wild-type and mutant p53 also conferred drug synergy but gradually showed compromised potency of growth inhibition. These data provide increased evidence that p53 status is a weak predictor for identifying an effective synergy, but genetic loss of p53 is relatively favorable for combination treatment. Further efforts on validation in more cell lines and clinical models could improve the predictive validity in this study."

Since direct p53 inhibition is an unsound therapeutic approach due carcinogenic effects, we investigated the expression of the cell death-associated p53 downstream targets c-fos, perp and fas in vulnerable motor neurons of SMA mice. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of SMA motor neurons revealed c-fos RNA as a promising candidate. Accordingly, we identified p53-dependent nuclear upregulation of c-Fos protein in degenerating motor neurons from the severe SMNΔ7 and intermediate Smn2B/– SMA mouse models. Although motor neuron-specific c-fos genetic deletion in SMA mice did not improve motor neuron survival or motor behavior, p53-dependent c-Fos upregulation marks vulnerable motor neurons in different mouse models. Thus, nuclear c-Fos accumulation may serve as a readout for therapeutic approaches targeting neuronal death in SMA and possibly other p53-dependent neurodegenerative diseases."

CK1α knockout usually causes both Wnt-β-catenin and p53 activation. Our results demonstrated that conditional disruption of CK1α in spermatogonia impaired spermatogenesis and resulted in male mouse infertility. The progenitor cell population was dramatically decreased in CK1α conditional knockout (cKO) mice, while the proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) was not affected. Further, our molecular analyses identified that CK1α loss was accompanied by nuclear stability of p53 protein in mouse spermatogonia, and dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that p53 directly targeted the Sox3 gene. In addition, p53 inhibitor Pifithrin-α (PFT-α) partially rescued the phenotype observed in cKO mice. Collectively, our data suggest that CK1α regulates spermatogenesis and male fertility through p53-Sox3 signaling and deepen our understanding of the regulatory mechanism underlying the male reproductive system."

They result in a protein that preferentially forms monomers or dimers, which are also normal p53 states under basal cellular conditions. However, their physiologic relevance is not well understood. We have established in vivo models for monomeric and dimeric p53, which model Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients with germline p53 TD alterations. p53 monomers are inactive forms of the protein. Unexpectedly, p53 dimers conferred some tumor suppression that is not mediated by canonical WT p53 activities. p53 dimers upregulate the PPAR pathway. These activities are associated with lower prevalence of thymic lymphomas and increased CD8+ T-cell differentiation. Lymphomas derived from dimeric p53 mice show cooperating alterations in the PPAR pathway, further implicating a role for these activities in tumor suppression. Our data reveal novel functions for p53 dimers and support the exploration of PPAR agonists as therapies.


SIGNIFICANCE
New mouse models with TP53R342P (monomer) or TP53A347D (dimer) mutations mimic Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Although p53 monomers lack function, p53 dimers conferred noncanonical tumor-suppressive activities. We describe novel activities for p53 dimers facilitated by PPARs and propose these are ""basal"" p53 activities."
36504811,P53 maintains gallid alpha herpesvirus 1 replication by direct regulation of nucleotide metabolism and ATP synthesis through its target genes,36504811,"P53, a well-known tumor suppressor, has been confirmed to regulate the infection of various viruses, including chicken viruses. Our previous study observed antiviral effect of p53 inhibitor Pifithrin-α (PFT-α) on the infection of avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), one of the major avian viruses economically significant to the poultry industry globally. However, the potential link between this antiviral effect of PFT-α and p53 remains unclear. Using chicken LMH cell line which is permissive for ILTV infection as model, we explore the effects of p53 on ILTV replication and its underlying molecular mechanism based on genome-wide transcriptome analysis of genes with p53 binding sites. The putative p53 target genes were validated by ChIP-qPCR and RT-qPCR. Results demonstrated that, consistent with the effects of PFT-α on ILTV replication we previously reported, knockdown of p53 repressed viral gene transcription and the genome replication of ILTV effectively. The production of infectious virions was also suppressed significantly by p53 knockdown. Further bioinformatic analysis of genes with p53 binding sites revealed extensive repression of these putative p53 target genes enriched in the metabolic processes, especially nucleotide metabolism and ATP synthesis, upon p53 repression by PFT-α in ILTV infected LMH cells. Among these genes, eighteen were involved in nucleotide metabolism and ATP synthesis. Then eight of the 18 genes were selected randomly for validations, all of which were successfully identified as p53 target genes. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms through which p53 controls ILTV infection, meanwhile expand our knowledge of chicken p53 target genes."

To elucidate the mechanism underlying the simultaneous recruitment of UBE2D2 and the substrate TADp53 by RINGMUL1, we determined the complex structure of RINGMUL1:UBE2D2 and studied the interaction between RINGMUL1 and TADp53 in the presence of UBE2D2–UB thioester (UBE2D2~UB) mimetics. The RINGMUL1‐binding induced the closed conformation of UBE2D2S22R/C85S–UBK48R oxyester (UBE2D2RS–UBROE), and strongly accelerated its hydrolysis, which was suppressed by the additional N77A‐mutation of UBE2D2. Interestingly, UBE2D2S22R/N77A/C85S–UBK48R oxyester (UBE2D2RAS–UBROE) already formed a closed conformation in the absence of RINGMUL1. Although TADp53 exhibited weak binding for RINGMUL1 or UBE2D2 alone, its binding affinity was enhanced and even further for RINGMUL1:UBE2D2 and RINGMUL1:UBE2D2RAS–UBROE, respectively. The recognition of TADp53 by RINGMUL1 as a complex with UBE2D2~UB is related to the multivalency of the binding events and underlies the ability of RINGMUL1 to ubiquitylate the intrinsically disordered protein, TADp53."

Many dVIN lesions demonstrate aberrant p53 staining; however, staining patterns overlap between dVIN and benign/reactive entities. We evaluate a p53/CK17 dual stain in an initial cohort of dVIN (n=30), benign vulvar skin (n=5), lichen sclerosus (LS, n=10), lichen simplex chronicus (LSC, n=10), and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia (PEH, n=10). In the initial cohort, aberrant p53 staining was seen only in dVIN (50%, 15/30). Equivocal p53 staining patterns were seen in dVIN (37%, 11/30), LS (50%, 5/10), LSC (40%, 4/10), and PEH (40%, 4/10). All 30 dVIN cases were positive for CK17 (strong partial-thickness or full-thickness staining), but positive CK17 staining was also seen in LS (70%, 7/10), LSC (50%, 5/10), and PEH (100%, 10/10). In the initial cohort, the combination of aberrant p53 and positive CK17 was seen only for dVIN (50%, 15/30). Forty cases of LS with known follow-up (20 with progression to dVIN, 20 without) were stained to assess prognostic value. Three LS cases showed aberrant p53 staining with CK17 positivity; all progressed to dVIN. Equivocal p53 staining and CK17 positivity were seen in cases with and without progression. The p53/CK17 dual stain is more diagnostically useful than either stain alone. Negative/focal staining for CK17 argues against a diagnosis of dVIN, while aberrant p53 staining with CK17 positivity strongly supports the diagnosis."
35737820,p53 gene delivery via a recombinant Salmonella enterica Typhimurium leads to human bladder carcinoma cell death in vitro,35737820,"Numerous studies have attempted to restore the function of the tumour suppressor p53 as an anti‐cancer strategy through gene delivery. However, most studies employed non‐bacterial vectors to deliver p53. Various facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria have been proposed as vectors because of their intrinsic tumour targeting ability and anti‐tumour activity. Salmonella enterica Typhimurium is the most studied bacterial vector in anti‐cancer therapy. We used the previously designed χ11218 strain of S. enterica Typhimurium, displaying regulated delayed lysis, as a vector for delivering p53 to human bladder carcinoma cells, restoring wild‐type p53 protein function. We cloned p53 into pYA4545 (containing a eukaryotic expression system) to generate the χ11218 pYA4545p53 strain. Cloning of p53 did not affect the growth or interfere with the invasive and replicative capacity of χ11218 bacteria in tumour cells. Human bladder carcinoma cells (expressing mutated p53) transfected with pYA4545p53 showed a significant increase in the expression of p53 protein. We demonstrated that p53 supplied by χ11218 significantly decreased the viability of human bladder cancer cells in a dose‐dependent manner. This study demonstrates the applicability of the attenuated χ11218 strain as a vector for DNA plasmids expressing tumour suppressor genes."

36104100,Restoration of p53 activity via intracellular protein delivery sensitizes triple negative breast cancer to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy,36104100,"Background Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been shown to yield promising therapeutic outcomes in a small subset of patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the majority of patients either do not respond or subsequently develop resistance. Recent studies have revealed the critical role of TP53 gene in cancer immunology. Loss or mutation of p53 in cancer cells has been found to promote their immune escape. Given the high mutation frequency of TP53 in TNBC cells, restoration of p53 function could be a potential strategy to overcome their resistance to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy. Herein, we have assessed the use of Pos3Aa crystal-based platform to mediate the intracellular delivery of p53 protein to restore p53 activity in p53 null tumors and consequently augment anti-PD-1 activity. Methods The efficiency of Pos3Aa-p53 crystals in delivering p53 protein was evaluated using confocal imaging, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry and RNA-seq. The ability of Pos3Aa-p53 crystals to remodel tumor microenvironment was investigated by examining the markers of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and the expression of PD-L1, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 and type I interferon (IFN). Finally, both unilateral and bilateral 4T1 tumor mouse models were utilized to assess the efficacy of Pos3Aa-p53 crystal-mediated p53 restoration in enhancing the antitumor activity of ICIs. T cells in tumor tissues and spleens were analyzed, and the in vivo biosafety of the Pos3Aa-p53 crystal/anti-PD-1 antibody combination was also evaluated. Results Delivery of p53 protein into p53-null TNBC 4T1 cells via Pos3Aa-p53 crystals restored the p53 activity, and therefore led to the induction of ICD, activation of type I IFN signaling and upregulation of PD-L1 expression. Pos3Aa-p53 crystals significantly enhanced T cell infiltration and activation in 4T1 tumors, thereby sensitizing them to anti-PD-1 therapy. The combination of Pos3Aa-p53 crystals with anti-PD-1 antibody also induced a systemic antitumor immunity resulting in the inhibition of distal tumor growth with minimal toxicity. Conclusion This study validates that p53 restoration can be an effective approach to overcome ICI resistance and demonstrates that intracellular delivery of p53 protein can be an efficient, safe and potentially universal strategy to restore p53 activity in tumors carrying TP53 mutation."

We demonstrated that doxorubicin induced apoptosis in U87 cells but not in T98G cells. The level of p53 was definitively correlated to the extent of DNA damage and apoptosis initiation. Dominant-negative p53 reduced p21 expression, but did not affect doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, so the transcriptional activity of p53 seemed not to participate in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. However, p53 concentrated into the nucleus during heavy apoptosis. Bortezomib could induce apoptosis in U87 with high sensitivity and T98G cells with low sensitivity. In contrast, vorinostat promoted apoptosis in both U87 and T98G cells and reduced the basal level of p53 in U87 cells, indicating that p53 played no role in the vorinostat-induced apoptosis. To clearly define the role of p53 in bortezomib- and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, we combined doxorubicin with bortezomib to treat U87 cells to assess this combination’s effect on apoptosis and p53 status. Interestingly, the combination of doxorubicin with bortezomib engendered compound stress, resulting in a synergistic outcome for apoptosis in U87 cells. However, the amounts of p53 in the total count and in the nucleus were much lower with the combination than with doxorubicin alone, suggesting that p53 played no role in either the compound stress, doxorubicin-only or bortezomib-induced apoptosis."

Although it has been demonstrated that the tumor suppressor p53 functions in endothelial cells to prevent the development of radiation-induced myocardial injury, the key mechanism(s) by which p53 regulates the radiosensitivity of cardiac endothelial cells is not completely understood. Here, we utilized genetically engineered mice that express mutations in p53 transactivation domain 1 (TAD1) (p5325,26) or mutations in p53 TAD1 and TAD2 (p5325,26,53,54) specifically in endothelial cells to study the p53 transcriptional program that protects cardiac endothelial cells from ionizing radiation in vivo. p5325,26,53,54 loses the ability to drive transactivation of p53 target genes after irradiation while p5325,26 can induce transcription of a group of non-canonical p53 target genes, but not the majority of classic radiation-induced p53 targets critical for p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. After 12 Gy whole-heart irradiation, we found that both p5325,26 and p5325,26,53,54 sensitized mice to radiation-induced cardiac injury, in contrast to wild-type p53. Histopathological examination suggested that mutation of TAD1 contributes to myocardial necrosis after whole-heart irradiation, while mutation of both TAD1 and TAD2 abolishes the ability of p53 to prevent radiation-induced heart disease. Taken together, our results show that the transcriptional program downstream of p53 TAD1, which activates the acute DNA damage response after irradiation, is necessary to protect cardiac endothelial cells from radiation injury in vivo."
36979860,P53 Deficiency Accelerate Esophageal Epithelium Intestinal Metaplasia Malignancy,36979860,"Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a precancerous lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). It is a pathological change in which the squamous epithelium distal esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium. Loss of P53 is involved in the development of BE and is taken as a risk factor for the progression. We established a HET1A cell line with P53 stably knockdown by adenovirus vector infection, followed by 30 days of successive acidic bile salt treatment. MTT, transwell assay, and wound closure assay were applied to assess cell proliferation and migration ability. The expression of key factors was analyzed by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. Our data show that the protein expression level of P53 reduced after exposure to acidic bile salt treatment, and the P53 deficiency favors the survival of esophageal epithelial cells to accommodate the stimulation of acidic bile salts. Furthermore, exposure to acidic bile salt decreases cell adhesions by repressing the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and activating VEGFR/AKT in P53-deficient esophageal cells. In EAC clinical samples, P53 protein expression is positively correlated with that of ICAM1 and STAT3 and negatively correlated with VEGFR protein expression levels. These findings elucidate the role of P53 in the formation of BE, explain the mechanism of P53 deficiency as a higher risk of progression for BE formation, and provide potential therapeutic targets for EAC."
36083253,Dexamethasone promotes osteoblast apoptosis through the Chk2/p53 signaling pathway.,36083253,"BACKGROUND
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used to treat inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. However, several studies have reported that the use of GCs can lead to numerous complications, the most serious of which are osteoporosis and osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Osteoblast apoptosis has been identified as an important event in the development of GC-induced osteoporosis and ONFH. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of these processes have not yet been explored.


OBJECTIVES
To observe the effect of dexamethasone (Dex) on the apoptosis of osteoblasts and explore its mechanism, as well as provide a new therapeutic idea for GC‑induced osteoporosis and ONFH.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell proliferation and apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells after Dex treatment were determined using the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit and Annexin V-FITC/PI Double Staining Apoptosis Detection Kit, respectively. The expression of caspase-3/cleaved caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)/cleaved PARP in MC3T3-E1 cells after Dex treatment was determined with western blotting. The expression of p53 and checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) in MC3T3-E1 cells after Dex treatment was analyzed using western blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The effects of p53 knockdown and Chk2 knockdown on Dex-induced apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells were also characterized.


RESULTS
Dexamethasone remarkably inhibited cell growth and induced the apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells. We also observed that Dex induced osteoblast apoptosis by promoting p53 expression. The regulatory effect of Dex on p53 expression is mediated by the upregulation of Chk2, which interacted with p53 and inhibited p53 degradation. The knockdown of p53 alleviated Dex-induced MC3T3-E1 cell apoptosis by decreasing the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP.


CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrated that Dex increased Chk2 protein expression, which stabilized the protein expression of p53, and in turn promoted osteoblast apoptosis."

However, the clinical translation of such therapeutic agents is often hampered by ferroptosis resistance and acquired drug tolerance in host cells. Emerging nanoplatform-based cascade engineering and ferroptosis sensitization by p53 provides a viable rescue strategy. Herein, a metallo-organic supramolecular (Nano-PMI@CeO2) toward p53 restoration and subsequent synergistic ferroptosis is constructed, in which the radical generating module-CeO2 nanoparticles act as the core, and p53-activator peptide (PMI)-gold precursor polymer is in situ reduced and assembled on the CeO2 surface as the shell. As expected, Nano-PMI@CeO2 effectively reactivated the p53 signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo, thereby downregulating its downstream gene GPX4. As a result, Nano-PMI@CeO2 significantly inhibited tumor progression in the lung cancer allograft model through p53 restoration and sensitized ferroptosis, while maintaining favorable biosafety. Collectively, this work develops a tumor therapeutic with dual functions of inducing ferroptosis and activating p53, demonstrating a potentially viable therapeutic paradigm for sensitizing ferroptosis via p53 activation. It also suggests that metallo-organic supramolecule holds great promise in transforming nanomedicine and treating human diseases."

The TP53 gene has inactivating mutations in about 50% of all human cancers. Some missense mutations lead to decreased thermal stability in the p53 protein, its unfolding and aggregation under physiological conditions. A general understanding of the impact of point mutations on the stability and conformation of mutant p53 is essential for the design and development of small molecules that target specific p53 mutations. In this work, we determined the thermostability properties of some of the most common mutant forms of the p53 protein—p53(R273H), p53(R248Q), p53(R248W) and p53(Y220C)—that are often considered as attractive therapeutic targets. The results showed that these missense mutations lead to destabilization of the p53 protein and a decrease in its melting temperature."

However, distinct stresses can generate the same p53 dynamics but different cell fate outcomes, suggesting integration of dynamic information from other pathways is important for cell fate regulation. To determine how MAPK activities affect p53‐mediated responses to DNA breaks and oxidative stress, we simultaneously tracked p53 and either ERK, JNK, or p38 activities in single cells. While p53 dynamics were comparable between the stresses, cell fate outcomes were distinct. Combining MAPK dynamics with p53 dynamics was important for distinguishing between the stresses and for generating temporal ordering of cell fate pathways. Furthermore, cross‐talk between MAPKs and p53 controlled the balance between proliferation and cell death. These findings provide insight into how cells integrate signaling pathways with distinct temporal patterns of activity to encode stress specificity and drive different cell fate decisions."

In this paper, we show that CLP36, an actinin-binding cytoskeletal protein, links p53 deficiency to up-regulation of YAP1 expression and sarcoma progression. Methods: Immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting were used to investigate the effect of p53 deficiency on CLP36 expression in sarcoma tissues and cells. Furthermore, molecular, cellular, and genetic knockout and knockdown approaches were employed to investigate the functions of CLP36 in regulation of sarcoma cell behavior in culture and tumor growth in mice. Finally, biochemical approaches were used to investigate the molecular mechanism by which CLP36 regulates the malignant behavior of p53 deficient sarcoma cells. Results: We have found that the expression of CLP36 is up-regulated in response to loss of p53 in sarcoma tissues and cells. Depletion of CLP36 inhibited malignant behavior of p53 deficient sarcoma cells. Furthermore, knockout of CLP36 in mice markedly inhibited p53 deficiency-induced tumorigenesis and improved the survival of the p53 deficient mice. Mechanistically, CLP36 promoted p53 deficiency-induced tumorigenesis through inhibition of E3 ligase atrophin-1 interacting protein-4 (AIP-4)-dependent proteasomal degradation of YAP1 and consequently increase of YAP1 expression. Conclusions: Our results reveal a crucial role of CLP36 in linking p53 deficiency to up-regulation of YAP1 expression and sarcoma progression. Our findings suggest that therapeutic targeting the CLP36/YAP1 signaling axis may provide an effective strategy for alleviation of p53 deficient sarcoma progression."
36355491,Identification of a Novel p53 Modulator Endowed with Antitumoural and Antibacterial Activity through a Scaffold Repurposing Approach,36355491,"Intracellular pathogens, such as Chlamydia trachomatis, have been recently shown to induce degradation of p53 during infection, thus impairing the protective response of the host cells. Therefore, p53 reactivation by disruption of the p53–MDM2 complex could reduce infection and restore pro-apoptotic effect of p53. Here, we report the identification of a novel MDM2 inhibitor with potential antitumoural and antibacterial activity able to reactivate p53. A virtual screening was performed on an in-house chemical library, previously synthesised for other targets, and led to the identification of a hit compound with a benzo[a]dihydrocarbazole structure, RM37. This compound induced p53 up-regulation in U343MG glioblastoma cells by blocking MDM2–p53 interaction and reduced tumour cell growth. NMR studies confirmed its ability to dissociate the MDM2–p53 complex. Notably, RM37 reduced Chlamydia infection in HeLa cells in a concentration-dependent manner and ameliorated the inflammatory status associated with infection."

Here, we found that p53 inhibits HCV replication by downregulating HCV Core protein levels in human hepatoma cells. For this effect, p53 potentiated the role of E6‐associated protein (E6AP) as an E3 ligase to induce ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HCV Core. Specifically, p53 facilitated the binding of E6AP to HCV Core through direct interactions with the two proteins. In addition, E6AP failed to induce ubiquitination of HCV Core in the absence of p53, suggesting that p53 increases the E3 ligase activity of E6AP in a triple complex consisting of p53, E6AP and HCV Core."
36848578,Multifaceted role for p53 in pancreatic cancer suppression.,36848578,"The vast majority of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) harbor TP53 mutations, underscoring p53's critical role in PDAC suppression. PDAC can arise when pancreatic acinar cells undergo acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), giving rise to premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), which finally progress to PDAC. The occurrence of TP53 mutations in late-stage PanINs has led to the idea that p53 acts to suppress malignant transformation of PanINs to PDAC. However, the cellular basis for p53 action during PDAC development has not been explored in detail. Here, we leverage a hyperactive p53 variant-p5353,54-which we previously showed is a more robust PDAC suppressor than wild-type p53, to elucidate how p53 acts at the cellular level to dampen PDAC development. Using both inflammation-induced and KRASG12D-driven PDAC models, we find that p5353,54 both limits ADM accumulation and suppresses PanIN cell proliferation and does so more effectively than wild-type p53. Moreover, p5353,54 suppresses KRAS signaling in PanINs and limits effects on the extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. While p5353,54 has highlighted these functions, we find that pancreata in wild-type p53 mice similarly show less ADM, as well as reduced PanIN cell proliferation, KRAS signaling, and ECM remodeling relative to Trp53-null mice. We find further that p53 enhances chromatin accessibility at sites controlled by acinar cell identity transcription factors. These findings reveal that p53 acts at multiple stages to suppress PDAC, both by limiting metaplastic transformation of acini and by dampening KRAS signaling in PanINs, thus providing key new understanding of p53 function in PDAC."
35345938,Prevalence of elevated Anti-p53 in Chinese patients with upper gastrointestinal or colorectal cancer,35345938,"Background The monitoring of anti-p53 auto-antibodies in the peripheral blood has been used in cancer management; however, their clinical significance alone is limited. This pilot study aimed to describe the prevalence of elevated anti-p53 in newly diagnosed or recurrent upper gastrointestinal cancer or colorectal cancer in Chinese subjects. It also evaluated whether the addition of anti-p53 to a set of established tumor markers would allow for the detection of additional cancer cases than when using these markers alone. Methods A total of 573 subjects, including 187 healthy individuals, 169 patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and 217 patients with colorectal cancer were included in this observational, prospective study. All subjects were required to provide up to 10 mL of blood. The following biomarkers were measured: anti-p53, carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen (CA)19-9, and CA72-4. Results At the cutoff of 0.02 µg/mL, the sensitivity of anti-p53 in early-stage upper gastrointestinal cancer and colorectal cancer was 8.16% and 26.4%, and in late-stage disease was 7.81 and 28.0%, respectively. The specificity of anti-p53 in the healthy cohort at this cutoff was 98.4%. By adding anti-p53 to other tumor markers, the sensitivities were increased by 8.88%–9.47% in upper gastrointestinal cancer, and by 18.06%–25.00% in colorectal cancer; specificities decreased by 1%–2%. Conclusion The addition of anti-p53 to established tumor markers may improve their diagnostic value for patients with colorectal cancer."
35904997,An Updated View of the Roles of p53 in Embryonic Stem Cells.,35904997,"The TP53 gene is unarguably one of the most studied human genes. Its encoded protein, p53, is a tumor suppressor and is often called the ""guardian of the genome"" due to its pivotal role in maintaining genome stability. Historically, most studies of p53 have focused on its roles in somatic cells and tissues, but in the last two decades, its functions in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells have attracted increasing attention. Recent studies have identified p53 as a critical regulator of pluripotency, self-renewal, differentiation, proliferation, and genome stability in mouse and human embryonic stem cells. In this article, we systematically review the studies on the functions of p53 in ESCs, provide an updated overview, attempt to reconcile controversial results described in the literature, and discuss the relevance of these cellular functions of p53 to its roles in tumor suppression."

Only a few studies have shed light on the mechanisms involved in the termination stage of LR. Here, we attempt to further verify the role of the p53/miR-34a/SIRT1 positive feedback loop in the termination of liver regeneration and its possible relationship with liver cancer. Method: We performed partial hepatectomy (PH) in mice transfected with adenovirus (Ade) overexpressing P53 and adenovirus-associated virus (AAV) overexpressing miR-34a. LR was analyzed by liver weight/body weight, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels and cell proliferation, and the related cellular signals were investigated. Bile acid (BA) levels during LR were analyzed by metabolomics of bile acids. Results: We found that the P53/miR-34a/SIRT1 positive feedback loop was activated in the late phase of LR. Overexpression of P53 or miR-34a terminated LR early and enhanced P53/miR-34a/SIRT1 positive feedback loop expression and its proapoptotic effect. T-β-MCA increased gradually during LR and peaked at 7 days after PH. T-β-MCA inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis via facilitating the P53/miR-34a/SIRT1 positive feedback loop during LR by suppressing FXR/SHP. The P53/miR-34a/SIRT1 positive feedback loop was abolished in HCC patients with P53 mutations. Conclusions: The P53/miR-34a/SIRT1 positive feedback loop plays an important role in the termination of LR. Our findings showed the molecular and metabolic mechanisms of LR termination and provide a potential therapeutic alternative for treating P53-wild-type HCC patients."
34028171,TERT mutation and the p53 pathway in T1 urinary bladder cancer.,34028171,"OBJECTIVE
To study the telomeras revers transcriptas (TERT) mutation and the p53 pathway in T1 urinary bladder cancer (UBC).


MATERIAL AND METHODS
This prospectively performed population-based study included all patients in the Southeast Healthcare Region in Sweden with T1 UBC registered in the period 1992-2001, inclusively. As p53 and TERT are important factors for tumour proliferation although their interrelations are not known we here studied the TERT mutation and the p53 mutation, and a p53 immuno-histochemical examination (IHC) was conducted using p53-positivity both in 10% and in 50% of tumour cells as cut-off levels. Cox Proportional Hazards Analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to study the time to tumour progression.


RESULTS
Out of 158 patients, we observed the TERT mutation in 74 (47%) patients, the p53 mutation in 48 (30%) patients, and p53 IHC 50% positive in 72 (46%) patients. The TERT mutation was more common in p53 mutation-positive patients (p=0.009), and the latter group also had more patients with p53 IHC 50% positive tumour cells (p=0.02). In the TERT mutation-negative tumours a p53-positive-mutation was associated with a shorter time to progression (p=0.03) compared to patients with p53-negative mutation. In contrast, in tumours with both the TERT mutation positive and the p53 mutation positive, a longer time to progression was observed in the group with p53 IHC 50% positive compared to p53 IHC50% negative tumours.


CONCLUSIONS
In stage T1 UBC, the combination of the TERT mutation and the p53 mutation was associated with tumour progression. A protective effect of the TERT promotor mutation against tumour progression induced by the p53 mutation and subsequent p53 accumulation in tumour cells might be possible but further investigations are necessary."
36099437,p53 pathway inactivation drives SMARCB1-deficient p53-wildtype epithelioid sarcoma onset indicating therapeutic vulnerability through MDM2 inhibition.,36099437,"Loss of the gene SMARCB1 drives the development of malignant rhabdoid tumors, epithelioid sarcomas, and other malignancies. The SMARCB1 protein is a core component of the SWI/SNF-family of chromatin remodeling complexes, which are important regulators of gene expression and cell differentiation. Here, we use CRISPR-Cas9 to create germline smarcb1 loss-of-function in zebrafish. We demonstrate that the combination of smarcb1-deficiency with mutant p53 results in the development of epithelioid sarcomas, angiosarcomas, and carcinomas of the thyroid and colon. Although human epithelioid sarcomas do not frequently harbor p53 mutations, smarcb1-deficient tumors in zebrafish were only observed following disruption of p53, indicating that p53 signaling in human tumors might be attenuated through alternative mechanisms, such as MDM2-mediated proteasomal degradation of p53. To leverage this possibility for the treatment of human epithelioid sarcoma, we tested small molecule-mediated disruption of the p53-MDM2 interaction, which stabilized p53 protein leading to p53-pathway reactivation, cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. Moreover, we found that MDM2 inhibition and the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin synergize in targeting epithelioid sarcoma cell viability. This could be especially relevant for epithelioid sarcoma patients since doxorubicin represents the current gold standard for their clinical treatment. Our results therefore warrant reactivating p53 protein in SMARCB1-deficient, p53-wildtype epithelioid sarcomas using combined doxorubicin and MDM2 inhibitor therapy."
35542987,CXCL10 is a novel anti‐angiogenic factor downstream of p53 in cardiomyocytes,35542987,"Tumor suppressor protein p53 plays crucial roles in the onset of heart failure. p53 activation results in cardiac dysfunction, at least partially by suppressing angiogenesis. Though p53 has been reported to reduce VEGF production by inhibiting hypoxia‐inducible factor, the anti‐angiogenic property of p53 remains to be fully elucidated in cardiomyocytes. To explore the molecular signals downstream of p53 that regulate vascular function, especially under normoxic conditions, DNA microarray was performed using p53‐overexpressing rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Among genes induced by more than 2‐fold, we focused on CXCL10, an anti‐angiogenic chemokine. Real‐time PCR revealed that p53 upregulated the CXCL10 expression as well as p21, a well‐known downstream target of p53. Since p53 is known to be activated by doxorubicin (Doxo), we examined the effects of Doxo on the expression of CXCL10 and found that Doxo enhanced the CXCL10 expression, accompanied by p53 induction. Importantly, Doxo‐induced CXCL10 was abrogated by siRNA knockdown of p53, indicating that p53 activation is necessary for Doxo‐induced CXCL10. Next, we examined the effect of hypoxic condition on p53‐mediated induction of CXCL10. Interestingly, CXCL10 was induced by hypoxia and its induction was potentiated by the overexpression of p53. Finally, the conditioned media from cultured cardiomyocytes expressing p53 decreased the tube formation of endothelial cells compared with control, analyzed by angiogenesis assay. However, the inhibition of CXCR3, the receptor of CXCL10, restored the tube formation. These data indicate that CXCL10 is a novel anti‐angiogenic factor downstream of p53 in cardiomyocytes and could contribute to the suppression of vascular function by p53."
35720128,Novel Allosteric Mechanism of Dual p53/MDM2 and p53/MDM4 Inhibition by a Small Molecule,35720128,"Restoration of the p53 tumor suppressor for personalised cancer therapy is a promising strategy. However, high-affinity MDM2 inhibitors have shown substantial side effects in clinical trials. Thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of action of p53 reactivating molecules with alternative functional principle is of the utmost importance. Here, we report a discovery of a novel allosteric mechanism of p53 reactivation through targeting the p53 N-terminus which blocks both p53/MDM2 and p53/MDM4 interactions. Using biochemical assays and molecular docking, we identified the binding site of two p53 reactivating molecules, RITA and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Ion-mobility mass spectrometry revealed that the binding of RITA to serine 33 and serine 37 is responsible for inducing the allosteric shift in p53, which shields the MDM2 binding residues of p53 and prevents its interactions with MDM2 and MDM4. Our results point to an alternative mechanism of blocking p53 interaction with MDM2 and MDM4 and may pave the way for the development of novel allosteric inhibitors of p53/MDM2 and p53/MDM4 interactions. Contribution to the field Given the immense importance of the p53 tumor suppressor for cancer, efforts have been made to identify p53 activators, which sterically inhibit MDM2. Because high-affinity MDM2 inhibitors are facing problems with considerable side effects, other approaches are needed to reactivate p53 for improved cancer therapy. The allosteric mechanism of action of p53 activator RITA, which we discovered, and its dependence on the oncogenic switch, is an unexpected turn in the p53 story. Our findings provide a basis for the development of p53 activators with a similar mode of functioning, either through the classical drug discovery route or through the drug repurposing approach. Allosteric modulators might have great potential as single agents, or in combination with the standard of care. Further, p53 modulators could serve as invaluable tools to better understand its biology."

36404121,Transcription‐independent functions of p53 in DNA repair pathway selection,36404121,"Recently discovered transcription‐independent features of p53 involve the choice of DNA damage repair pathway after PARylation, and p53's complex formation with phosphoinositide lipids, PI(4,5)P2. PARylation‐mediated rapid accumulation of p53 at DNA damage sites is linked to the recruitment of downstream repair factors and tumor suppression. This links p53's capability to sense damaged DNA in vitro and its relevant functions in cells. Further, PI(4,5)P2 rapidly accumulates at damage sites like p53 and complexes with p53, while it is required for ATR recruitment. These findings help explain how p53 and PI(4,5)P2 maintain genome stability by directing DNA repair pathway choice. Additionally, there is a strong correlation between p53 sequence homology, genome mutation rates as well as lifespans across various mammalian species. Further investigation is required to better understand the connections between genome stability, tumor suppression, longevity and the transcriptional‐independent function of p53."
35278081,Artificial Intelligence Program to Predict p53 Mutations in Ulcerative Colitis-Associated Cancer or Dysplasia.,35278081,"BACKGROUND
The diagnosis of colitis-associated cancer or dysplasia is important in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Immunohistochemistry of p53 along with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is conventionally used to accurately diagnose the pathological conditions. However, evaluation of p53 immunohistochemistry in all biopsied specimens is expensive and time-consuming for pathologists. In this study, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence program using a deep learning algorithm to investigate and predict p53 immunohistochemical staining from H&E-stained slides.


METHODS
We cropped 25 849 patches from whole-slide images of H&E-stained slides with the corresponding p53-stained slides. These slides were prepared from samples of 12 patients with colitis-associated neoplasia who underwent total colectomy. We annotated all glands in the whole-slide images of the H&E-stained slides and grouped them into 3 classes: p53 positive, p53 negative, and p53 null. We used 80% of the patches for training a convolutional neural network (CNN), 10% for validation, and 10% for final testing.


RESULTS
The trained CNN glands were classified into 2 or 3 classes according to p53 positivity, with a mean average precision of 0.731 to 0.754. The accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, positive predictive value (precision), and F-measure of the prediction of p53 immunohistochemical staining of the glands detected by the trained CNN were 0.86 to 0.91, 0.73 to 0.83, 0.91 to 0.92, 0.82 to 0.89, and 0.77 to 0.86, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
Our trained CNN can be used as a reasonable alternative to conventional p53 immunohistochemical staining in the pathological diagnosis of colitis-associated neoplasia, which is accurate, saves time, and is cost-effective."
